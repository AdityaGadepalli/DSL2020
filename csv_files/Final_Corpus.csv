0,Rs 1057 crore recovered in GST frauds across the country : 15th jan20 ~ E-Pao! Headlines,"Rs 1057 crore recovered in GST frauds across the country

Source: IT News

Mumbai , January 14 2020: The officials of an anti-evasion wing of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST), recovered nearly Rs.1057 crore by registering 6641 cases involving 7164 entities, engaged in frauds such claiming GST refund under bogus income credit claims, all over the country. The cases included 931 cases of fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC) cases registered in Kolkata zone followed by Delhi, Jaipur and Punchkula (Haryana) .



These case were detected through data analytics, which revealed that the fraudsters had created a network of over 500 entities comprising fake billers, intermediary dealers, distributors and bogus manufacturers of hawai chappals for availing and encashing fake ITC in Uttarakhand.



The bogus ""manufacturers"" were making supplies to other fictitious entities and retailers in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.



The raw material for the chappals, known as Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA)( a plastic made by combining ethylene and vinyl acetate) attracts 18 per cent GST, whereas ready chappals are charged 5 per cent GST.



Resultantly the manufacturers are allowed to claim refund of the inverted duty structure in cash.



In Uttarakhand the fraudsters had created over Rs.600 crore of 'fake credit', which they would have continued to encash had it not been busted and fake refund claims worth Rs 27.5 crore were prevented.



The main accused in this case was arrested in December and was sent to judicial custody.



Another Integrated Goods and Service Tax (IGST) fraud came to light in Surat in Gujarat in which 19 firms had fraudulently claimed ITC to the tune of Rs 55 crore against the fake invoices valued at Rs.679 crore.



During the search of the premises of two kingpin firms M/s Satyam Impex and M/s Aatif Fashion, it was revealed that 17 other firms were registered with GST by misusing the identity/documents of daily wagers, casual workers, etc.



Data analytics revealed that these 19 firms had issued invoices valued at Rs.461 crore involving IGST worth Rs.39 crore for exports and invoices valued at Rs.196 crore involving GST to the tune of Rs.12 crore for domestic supply.



Perpetrators of this fraud later confessed that they used to receive fake invoices from fake firms without receipt of goods and have availed fraudulent ITC to claim refund of IGST.



They used to purchase cheaper quality textile items from market for export and used the said high value invoices for claiming IGST refund.



Refunds of over Rs 28,000 crore have been filed by over 27,000 taxpayers on account of inverted duty structure in the current year so far.



Such identified taxpayers who have purchased goods from tax evading non-filers would face verification and scrutiny.



To curb ITC frauds, data analytics will be done on all refunds since 2017 .



The fraud detected by central tax authorities in Delhi, involving GST refund for inverted duty structure, was deliberated at the 2nd National Conference on GST last week.

1,DGGI officials arrest two over massive GST fraud,"Kolkata: Two persons have been arrested by the officials of Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence (DGGI), Kolkata Zonal Unit, on Tuesday, for their involvement in a case of GST fraud.



The accused persons were produced before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,

Sealdah and have been remanded to judicial custody till March 6.

According to the Joint Director of DGGI, Kolkata Zonal Unit, K Kalpana, the accused persons identified as Kamal Kumar Jain and Deepak Upadhyay used to operate a racket and had floated a number of fake companies which existed only on paper.

They also used to pass several fake invoices without any supply of goods or services. But based on those invoices, the accused persons used to take input tax credit, which were passed on to the recipient companies.

As per the system, if a person sells some goods or provides service to another person, then the buyer has an option to avail tax credit. As the buyer has already paid an amount as GST to the seller, he is entitled to get the benefit.

After he makes something out of the bought goods, he pays the GST to the government, after adjusting the tax paid to the seller.

In such fraud cases usually fake companies are floated and fake invoices are generated. In this case, Jain and Upadhyay had taken tax credit amounting to approximately Rs 96 crore after generating invoices worth Rs 500 crore of bogus transactions.

To make the transactions look regular, they were made through Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS). It has also been found that such fake invoices were passed on to companies across the country for availing irregular input tax credit, causing huge loss to the government.

On Tuesday, acting on a tip-off, DGGI officials conducted search operation in 10 locations from where a huge number of incriminating documents were seized.

After scrutinising the seized documents, the racket was unearthed. DGGI, Kolkata Zonal Unit had earlier arrested six persons in connection with similar cases.

7,Budget 2020: Faking GST Input Tax Likely To Become A Non-bailable Crime,"Government is pressing pedals for making ever-stringent laws against fraudulent claims, making bogus claims for input tax credit a non-bailable offence at the end of recipients of goods and services is one such step which is going to be introduced in the February 1 budget, that would occlude revenue leakages.

Proposals have been made to augment the Sections 122 and 132 of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Act by including recipients discovered guilty of committing such fraud under the sections.

At present, no provision that specifies clear-cut measures to behave towards tax-evasion practices is available under the GST regime.

A government official told, “Changes are being proposed to the law to plug issues related to fraud input tax credit.”

The GST Council and the law committee has sanctioned the proposed additions to Sections 122 and 132 of the GST Act. According to these proposals, penalties can be imposed on CXOs, employees, directors who are directly accountable for claiming bogus ITC, in order to curb evasion.

For the bailable offence, the threshold has been kept at INR 5 crores, beyond this limit, the offence will be labelled as non-bailable. Currently, the provision applies to suppliers of goods and services.

“A value-added tax like GST should have explicit penalties to deal with cases where active collusion results in input tax credit frauds,” said MS Mani, partner, Deloitte India. “Such cases by a small community of taxpayers lead to increasing compliance and procedural requirements on all taxpayers.”

Another proposal to equally penalise the beneficiaries of these crooked claims, often harvested through dummy companies, has also been by one of the officials.

So far, many cases of claiming ITC refund without receipts or invoices of goods and services, that evidences the transactions, have been registered by GST authorities. An addition of a blunt and precise provision in the GST Act will lay a standard format to deal with such instances.

An official said the names of daily wage earners such as rickshaw pullers and others are being used to open multiple firms that issue invoices without the supply of goods or services to pass on the input tax credit.

According to an official, many firms have been using the names of daily breadwinners like street vendors, rickshaw pullers, etc. to issue invoices in the absence of any actual supply of goods or services to turn over the ITC. These coordinators, who support such deceptive acts, set up for actual suppliers of goods or services to whom these receipts & invoices will be sold out on a fixed amount of money.

The GST Council has also endorsed changes to Section 49 of the GST Act empowering officials to block credit in the case of fraud. This will also be introduced in the budget.

Besides, the proposal to amend Section 49 has also been approved by the GST Council. This proposal authorises GST officials to hold on the credit which results out of fraud and will be introduced in the budget.

As per the experts, such amendments will demand a comprehensive explanation to avert ambiguity.

“While there is a need to have legislative recourse to prevent such instances, it’s important that government issues detailed guidelines as to how and when these provisions have to be invoked so that the possibility of misuse can be minimised,” said Pratik Jain, indirect tax leader, PwC.",NA,"Proposals have been made to augment the Sections 122 and 132 of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Act by including recipients discovered guilty of committing such fraud under the sections.

8,Mumbai: Pharma firm director arrested for Rs 158 crore GST fraud,"Mumbai: The Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) authorities recently arrested the director of Sulabh Pharmaceutical Pvt Ltd for causing Rs 158 crore revenue loss to the Government, by allegedly using bogus invoices sans receipts of goods or services to avail the Input Tax Credit (ITC), suggests recent media reports.

ITC is the credit manufacturer's received for paying input taxes towards inputs used in the manufacture of products. Similarly, a dealer is entitled to the input tax credit if he has purchased goods for resale. In other words, it allows taxpayers to claim credit for taxes paid on purchases.

On January 7, based on a tip-off, the CGST officials conducted raids in four different places including Sulabh Pharma's director, Pravinkumar Prajapati's office based in Malad.

During the raid, the officials found incriminating documents establishing GST violations. Investigations revealed that Prajapati had opened 17 firms in his name and his family members and employees. All these firms were fully or partially controlled by them. The firms would allegedly issue invoices among themselves in a circular manner and fraudulently avail inadmissible ITC. Later, only paper transactions were carried out by issuing invoices among these firms without any sale, purchase, or supply of goods or services.

16,View: Govt needs a carrot-and-stick policy for better GST collections,"Two years after introducing a poorly thought out, and hastily pushed through, Goods and Services Tax ( GST ), the government is grappling with a botched system. Middlemen and canny businessmen are gaming the system.By the Centre’s own estimates, the administration succumbed to Rs 45,682 crore in GST fraud by mid last year. The government must shift to a single rate and introduce a credit score for taxpayers, linked to ease of business, in order to encourage compliance.In simple terms, the government needs to start rewarding good behaviour, or tax compliance, and punishing bad behaviour, or tax evasion. But to get going, it must clean up its own system and introduce a flat GST rate across the board so that compliance becomes genuinely easier for all, as does calculating input taxes to use as offsets.Vijay Kelkar, the architect of GST and former finance secretary, has steadily held that the rate works best as a single rate rather than multiple slabs. In his 2019 book with economist Ajay Shah, In the Service of the Republic: The Art and Science of Economic Policy, Kelkar says, ""a single 10% rate applied on 70% of the economy yields 7% of GDP as tax revenues and even if we actually obtain a part of this, we are broadly okay.""Shah and he argue that with the rate flat and low, it would be possible for the government to include categories such as petroleum, real estate and alcoholic drinks that are currently excluded from the GST rate. To be fair, it’s well established that tax evasion tends to be the highest in cash economies. The government needs to accept that in India, which is still largely a cash economy , even a simple system of taxation will only really nudge the compliance-minded and those outside the cash economy, to be more diligent.The government’s task, therefore, is to have a carrot-and-stick policy to coax more businesses to pay tax and incentivise those who do.Having an annual scorecard for all registered GST businesses might help. These scores, a bit like a reputation score, should rate the GST payer on a range of things from deadlines, accuracy, compliance and so on. Those who tick all the boxes more or less consistently, should be allowed to earn a higher score. This system is no different from a credit score for borrowers, where those who pay their debts on time get a top credit rating. These scores should also allow for automatic correction where the taxpayer was unable to pay because of a system error or a government-introduced stumbling block.These annual reputation scores can then be used for anything from a preferential lending rate with a bank, priority to avail public schemes, single-window clearances and all the stuff that makes it easier to do business.Tribunals and appellate bodies could fast track cases of businesses with higher reputation scores. Banks could also look at the reputation score to see how good the borrower is with compliance, a reasonable indicator of trustworthiness.These reputation ratings or scores could eventually be used by all businesses to choose compliant suppliers and service providers.Individuals and businesses gaming the system should be black-marked and ring-fenced, making it far more expensive to do business. And where criminality is established, they should be barred from opening new businesses, bank accounts and so on.Of course, those determined to game the system will find ways around this too. But it might discourage mass evasion.Ultimately, the message should go out to taxpayers that those who are compliant and diligent will have better access to goods and services in the country, which they pay for.To make it work, India will have to invest heavily in world-class data processing, machine learning (ML) and sophisticated algorithms that will weed out inaccuracy and spot fraud. And the tax department should run extensive pilots before dumping untested systems on taxpayers and frustrating them. The government must ensure the system cannot be manipulated at the hands of swathes of inefficient, overbearing and, quite often, corrupt tax officers.For a buy-in to happen, taxpayers must be assured of fairness, accuracy and transparency of the ratings. Any government committed to digitisation must improve clumsy and cumbersome taxation systems, even as it looks to improve tax collections to meet lofty spending goals.",NA,"Two years after introducing a poorly thought out, and hastily pushed through, Goods and Services Tax ( GST ), the government is grappling with a botched system.

18,Intel agencies seek RBI help to check money laundering,"New Delhi: Continuing to keep the heat on big time money launderers who operate through banking channels, a multi-agency group has suggested integration of core banking systems of all banks to monitor movement of funds within multiple shell companies having accounts in different banks to establish the end beneficiaries. The targets can be identified using data analytics and artificial intelligence once CBS of different banks are integrated.A joint working group of leading agencies, including the Income Tax Serious Fraud Investigation Office and also having representatives of the RBI and Security Exchange Board of India, deliberated on unrestricted flow of black money through RTGS in different accounts before reaching actual beneficiaries. The agencies are of the view that all banks should integrate CBS with each other and use data analytics and artificial intelligence to trace these beneficiaries.The government had in the past few years deregistered more than 6.5 lakh companies which were inactive and had not been filing their returns. Lakhs of these companies had no business activity but had significant monetary transactions. Investigative agencies like the income tax and ED identified thousands of them operating as shell companies merely to launder black money.At a recent meeting of the joint working group, coordinated by the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau, an arm of the finance ministry, the matter came up for discussion where members suggested that tracking layered transactions of similar amounts could throw more light on several business enterprises still indulging in laundering of black money using the banking channel. It has been proposed that using data analytics, flow of funds of similar amounts into multiple bank accounts could easily be tracked if all banks integrate their CBS. TheRBI, which regulates all banks, has been requested to look into the matter and work towards integrating these banks through a common CBS.Each of the commercial banks have already integrated all their branches through own CBS, but once the funds are transferred to any other bank, the tracking is difficult at the source. After the Punjab National Bank fraud in the Nirav Modi case came to light, it was found that the bank had not been entering certain international transactions made through SWIFT software in their own CBS that made it difficult for detection of the fraud for several years. Soon after, the RBI in 2018 issued guidelines making it mandatory for all banks to integrate their SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Transaction) with the CBS.",NA,"New Delhi: Continuing to keep the heat on big time money launderers who operate through banking channels, a multi-agency group has suggested integration of core banking systems of all banks to monitor movement of funds within multiple shell companies having accounts in different banks to establish the end beneficiaries.

27,Taxman may get to block doubtful input tax credit,"The government is set to amend Section 49 of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) law that would allow tax officers to block input tax credit of companies if they suspect fraud, an agenda note for the GST council meeting circulated to all state finance ministers and senior tax officials indicated.“Fraudulent ITC (input tax credit) availment based on fake invoices has become quite rampant. As investigations get initiated, if the utilisation of such suspected credit continues, the investigation efforts get frustrated,” the government document reads.“The commissioner or an officer authorised by him on this behalf, may restrict utilisation of full or part amount from the credit available in the electronic credit ledger for making any payment towards output tax or claiming input tax credit refund,” part of the amended section reads.Industry trackers said giving additional powers to the tax officers may create problems in the coming days. Senior tax officers would be able to partially or fully block input tax credit of companies henceforth. This comes at a time when indirect tax officers have been arresting promoters if they suspect “circular trading” with an aim to avail input tax credit.“Giving arbitrary and unfettered powers to commissioners to reject or withhold input credit claims based on whims and fancies will lead to harassment and eventually impact the already traumatised economy. There is a problem in the law which needs to be changed, but to propose to amend a section without actually coming out with regulations on how to determine whether the input tax credit is actually fake, will only add to the existing problems,” said Sujay Kantawala, high court advocate who also represents several promoters arrested by indirect tax officials.Tax experts also question what would happen in cases where a company challenges taxman’s stand and wins a case in the court. “It is important to understand whether in cases where credit has been wrongly blocked, the taxpayer will get the interest for the delayed period of non-utilisation as the tax payer should be appropriately compensated for delay in utilisation of credit,” said Abhishek A Rastogi, partner at Khaitan & Co.Several promoters have challenged in different forums indirect tax officials’ right to arrest them.

36,Two held for Rs 107 crore GST fraud; another absconding,"Valanchery (Malappuram): Two members of a gang that swindled a whopping Rs 107 crore by taking Goods and Services Tax (GST) registration in the name of others have been arrested.

Valanchery police Sub Inspector T. Manoharan said that this was the first GST input tax fraud in the state. Another gang member managed to escape.

The two were identified as Rashid Rafeeq (29) of Ponnani and his brother in law Faisal Nazar (24). The third gang member, Muhammad, escaped after learning that police had come to his house in search of him.

Police have registered cases against the duo for cheating and forging documents. The officials raided the house of the two and seized currency counting machines, cheque books and stamp papers.

The arrests were made following investigations based on a complaint by Yusuf of Valanchery. There are three GST accounts in the name of Yusuf. Police said that 15 others have been cheated by the two accused.

While Rashid Rafeeq was nabbed from Thiruvananthapuram, Faisal Nazar was nabbed from Bengaluru. Two police teams have gone to bring the two to Valanchery.

The gang was working based in Malappuram, Thrissur, Palakkad, Kozhikode, Wayanad and Kasaragod districts. They used the names of three registered companies – Y. S. Trading (Malappuram), Star Enterprises and Das Agencies (Ahmedabad).

How the fraud came to light

When GST officials came to the house of Ranjith, of Edayur in Valanchery, they learned that the accused were operating a company Raj Enterprises in his name. The accused swindled Rs 13 crore in the name of Ranjith alone.

The accused have swindled Rs 20 to Rs 30 crores each using the accounts of the cheated people. If the taxes and fines are taken into consideration, the victims will have to pay several lakhs.

Modus operandi

Chief agent Muhammad approaches people who are seeking to earn revenue and helps them start areca nut (betel nut) business. Muhammad opens a GST account in their name and both start selling areca nuts to other states.

Muhammad says he has many businesses and insists that the taxes be paid through a single account. He offers them Rs 50,000 per month after three months. Using this account, the accused will show trade of goods worth substantial amount without actually moving any goods. The non-existing goods will be traded to companies in Delhi or Gujrat.

Police assume that the accused obtained the GST input tax of trading these non-existing goods in the following days.

The Anti-Evasion wing of CGST Delhi South Commissionerate today unearthed yet another case of fake invoicing and GST fraud involving fake invoicing of Rs 1,600 crores and tax evasion of Rs 241 crores, said a statement by the Ministry of Finance. This time, the fraud was related to a provision of inverted duty structure, which is an arrangement where raw materials have a higher duty, while the finished products attract lower duty.

The investigations have also found a well organised racket of creating bogus firms, issuing fake invoices and bogus e-way bills to generate and encash tax credits. The racketeer had created several firms on the basis of unauthorised access to identity documents of various persons.

Earlier this week, the findings disclosed by states and other stakeholders to the Committee of Officers revealed that the central and the state governments together are facing Rs 20,000 crore revenue loss due to refunds claimed by companies on account of flaws in the GST rate structure. And these types of frauds act as a double-edged sword, giving additional scars to the revenue collection.

Meanwhile, GST Council has introduced the ‘E-invoicing’ facility in a phased manner for reporting of business to business (B2B) invoices to GST System, starting from 1 January 2020 on a voluntary basis. Along with the other benefits, this facility is also believed to check tax evasion.

40,"GST collection falls for third consecutive month, slips to Rs 91,916 cr in September","During April-September, the domestic component has grown by 7.82 per cent. During April-September, the domestic component has grown by 7.82 per cent.

Amid the slump in the economic activity, the Goods and Services Tax collection in September declined to Rs 91,916 crore, as against Rs 98,202 crore in the preceding month. The revenue collection in the same month, a year ago, stood at Rs 94,442 crore. The figures were released by the government on Tuesday.

“The total gross GST revenue collected in the month of September 2019 is Rs 91,916 crore of which CGST is Rs 16,630 crore, SGST is Rs 22,598 crore, IGST is Rs 45,069 crore (including Rs 22,097 crore collected on imports) and cess is Rs 7,620 crore (including Rs 728 crore collected on imports),” the Finance Ministry said in a release.

Meanwhile, during the April-September period, the domestic component has grown by 7.82 per cent, while the GST on imports has shown negative growth and the total collection has grown by 4.90 per cent, the release added.

Earlier, the collections had dropped to Rs 98,202 crore in August from over Rs 1.02 lakh crore in July 2019. This is the third time during this year that the revenue collection from the GST slipped below the Rs 1 lakh crore mark. First, it happened in June when the collection was Rs 99,939 crore. However, it was Rs 1.02 lakh crore in July.

GST was India’s biggest reform in indirect tax structure which introduced a single tax on the supply of goods and services, from the manufacturing stage until its delivery to the final consumer. The final consumer of the goods and/or services only have to bear the GST charged by the final dealer in the supply chain, and avail set-off benefits at all the previous stages. This means interim tax stages such as excise duties and service tax and state levies like VAT are absorbed under GST.

41,"GST fraud: 1,200 untraceable exporters made refund claims worth Rs 350 crore","The detection of fraud led to saving the exchequer over Rs 350 crore of refunds, they added. (File) The detection of fraud led to saving the exchequer over Rs 350 crore of refunds, they added. (File)

Goods and Services Tax (GST) authorities have discovered fraudulent refund claims worth Rs 350 crore made by as many as 1,200 exporters. The Revenue Department, using data analytics, has stopped the refund claims since the exporters were untraceable.

Sources said nefarious elements among the customs broker community may be connected with these frauds, involving fictitious entities, existing only in virtual space through identity thefts with fake and morphed documents. The detection of fraud led to saving the exchequer over Rs 350 crore of refunds, they added.

The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs has obligated customs brokers under their licensing conditions to independently verifying the KYC of exporters, sources noted. However, going by the cases detected in recent months, at least 50 customs brokers have been found to have dealt by and large with such exporter entities which are untraceable at their registered addresses and such custom brokers are also under the lens, the sources said.

A company was investigated and led to discovery of a fraudulent refund claim of Rs 9.88 crore. As per the investigation, the firm was ostensibly exporting ready-made garments to an SEZ.

GST authorities, using data analytics-based risk management, selected the taxpayer for physical scrutiny, who was then found non-existent at his declared address, they noted.

Using a web of fake invoicing of over Rs 847 crore, the firm created a fraudulent credit of Rs 195 crore and investigations led to discovering untraceable suppliers.

The Revenue Department is carrying out risk evaluation of exporters with the help of predictive modelling, sources said.

42,Goods and Services Tax: Panel to look into automated system to tag risky taxpayers,"Changes, if required, in law to include penal provisions for failure to undertake the desired KYC compliance or verification are being considered by the government. Changes, if required, in law to include penal provisions for failure to undertake the desired KYC compliance or verification are being considered by the government.

An automated system of identifying risky entities through risk-based profiling of taxpayers under Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime and changes, if required, in law to include penal provisions for failure to undertake the desired KYC compliance or verification by such entities are being considered by the government. The GST Council has formed a 10-member ‘Committee of Officers on Risk-Based Management of Taxpayers under GST regime’, which will submit its report within a month.

The officers’ committee will study, examine and suggest the modalities for assessing financial credibility of a taxpayer vis-à-vis his/her GST profile and may also suggest various threshold limits for such taxpayers. Also, the officers’ committee will suggest reasonable restrictions/ interventions to be imposed on taxpayers based on risk parameters to regulate issue of invoices, utilisation of input tax credit, passing of input tax credit, refunds etc.

“…the Committee of Officers on risk-based management of taxpayers under GST regime shall study, examine and suggest measures for implementation of suggested risk-based management on immediate basis and any other measures, mechanism and machinery to check and curb multiple types of frauds,” the office memorandum dated July 15 stated. Modalities of KYC verification of a taxpayer through various agencies, parameters for risk-based profiling of a taxpayer so as to identify ‘risky’ entity in an automated manner will be suggested by the officers committee.

Gujarat’s Chief Commissioner of State Tax P D Vaghela, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) Principal Commissioner, GST Policy Wing Upender Gupta have been named the co-conveners of the 10-member officers committee. Other members include officials from Directorate General of Analytics and Risk Management (DG ARM), DG System and Data Management and GST Network (GSTN).

GST collections had fallen short of the Budget target by Rs 1.6 lakh crore and by around Rs 62,000 crore from the revised estimates in the previous financial year, prompting the government to look at various data-analytics based anti-evasion measures to shore up revenues. In his post-Budget interview with The Indian Express earlier this month, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey had said that with the Indian economy expected to grow only marginally higher this fiscal, the government will explore anti-evasion measures to increase the efficiency of revenue collections.

“We have estimated 11 per cent as nominal (GDP) growth, and we are saying 14 per cent (growth target for GST revenue). This difference between 11 and 14 per cent will come from increasing our efficiency of collection and that includes taking anti-evasion measures,” Pandey said.

Apart from economic slowdown creating a dent on the growth of GST collections, the government is also grappling with revenue leaks due to multiple fraud cases under the indirect tax regime. A total of 9,385 cases of tax fraud involving amount of Rs 45,682.83 crore has been detected by the tax authorities under the GST regime since its rollout from July 1,2017, government data showed. Out of this, 1,593 tax fraud cases involving an amount of Rs 6,520.40 crore have been detected in April-June, the first three months of this financial year.

Tax fraud worth Rs 37,946.41 crore was detected in 7,368 cases in 2018-19. Also, in 2018-19, Rs 11,251 crore worth of cases of tax credit availment by issue of fake invoices were detected by the tax authorities and Rs 2,805 crore in April-June of the current fiscal.

In 2018-19, 1,620 cases of fake invoicing were detected involving Rs 11,251.23 crore, and 154 persons were arrested. Between April-June of 2019-20, 666 cases of fake invoicing were detected and the amount involved stood at Rs 2,804.98 crore. A total of 41 persons were arrested.

The UT Excise and Taxation department is yet to recommend the Chandigarh police to take criminal action against RD Trading Company, one of the six companies accused of a multicrore GST scam, even as orders were issued against the firm in August.

On inspection, it was revealed that RD Trading, a scrap dealing company, registered at Burail village in Sector 45, did not conduct its business activities at its registered address. Moreover, the company had claimed to have a turnover of Rs 8.84 crore on the back of fake sales and purchase invoices.

Followoing the investigation, the UT Excise and Taxation department had slapped a penalty of Rs 2.32 crore against the company, as it had caused a loss of over Rs 2 crore to the UT administration on the pretext of input tax credit (ITC) with the Chandigarh Excise and Taxation department.

Owners of two bogus trading companies were booked for allegedly submitting fake bills to evade GST tax to the tune of Rs 14.21 crore. The two accused allegedly claimed Input Tax Credit (ITC) with Chandigarh Excise and Taxation department even as the they did not purchase anything or receive services from other companies.

ITC is the amount deducted while paying tax on the “output product”. The deducted amount is equivalent to the money paid by a company while purchasing the raw material that went into that product. The accused were identified as Anuradha, proprietor of AK Trading Company at Khuda Jassu village, and Rajeev Kumar of Vinita Enterprises at Milk colony, Dhanas.

A police officer said, “Anuradha is a widow. The address in Khuda Jassu, where she claimed her company exist, belongs to her father. We have not found any company at the address. Her father maintained that Anuradha had used a fake rent agreement for obtaining the GSIT number. We also raided Vinita Enterprises address at Milk colony in Dhanas. No one was found there. There was no company structure. UT Excise and Taxation department is yet to give us the fake bills, invoices etc submitted by them with the taxation department.”

The Economic Offenses Wing (EOW) is conducting the probe. The two FIRs were registered on the complaints of Excise and Taxation Department. Both the accused are absconding. The two had also obtained GSIT numbers for their firms on the basis of fake rent agreements.

UT Excise and Taxation Commissioner-cum-DC Mandeep Singh Brar conducted an internal probe against five bogus companies including these two before moving a police complaint. The five companies have allegedly committed a fraud of Rs 70 crore.

Sources said internal probe against three other companies — RJ Enterprises in Makhanmajra, Mahadev Metals in Dariya and RD Trading Co in Sector 45 — are still pending.

Sources in the excise department said, “These bogus companies were registered and obtained GSIT number from UT administration for doing the business of scrap sales-purchase. The five bogus firms issued fake bills without any other company either purchasing or providing any goods or services from/to them. The bills bought by these companies, mostly situated in neighboring states were then used to claim input tax credit (ITC) from the government.”

On preliminary scrutiny, it was seen that the inward supplies of the said firm were not in correlation with outward supplies. All these firms have resorted to sale or cause effect of sale of goods, by issuing goods-less invoices and, on collection of the payment by cheque, pay back in cash to the party in question. This is done in order to facilitate these firms under investigation to avail Input Tax Credit for offsetting any likely tax liability and, in some cases, availing IGST refunds.

To unearth modus operandi and nab the mastermind, DGGI Mumbai launched an operation: by following the money trail of the IGST refund obtained, several searches were conducted all over India on the premises of CHA, many companies, key persons, forex dealer, commission agents and freight forwarders, and several statements were recorded.

It was revealed that Desai, a resident of Surat, who is also director, promoter and operator of 15 companies, connived with several persons for availment and utilization of Input Tax Credit of Rs. 41.15 crores and further availment of IGST refund of Rs. 38.55 crores on the strength of bogus and fake invoices.

Desai was arrested on Saturday and produced before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court in Mumbai, who remanded him to 14 days judicial custody. It was also gathered that he is a habitual offender and had been arrested by the Central Excise Department, Surat, in 2005 for export rebate fraud and by DRI, Mumbai, in 2007 for over valuation of exports.

The accused person created a complex web using multiple layers of transactions, through custom house agents, freight forwarders, forex dealers, individuals, and commission agents, and made exports using different IECs and different bank accounts.

It was a major racket that involved persons who helped in the creation of dummy exporters, entities involved in the movement of refund proceeds in multiple layers, forex dealers and companies and persons who finally encashed it in cash form and returned it to the mastermind.

Tejas Desai was actively controlling these transactions at all levels, said the Ministry of Finance, adding that further investigation is under progress.

63,A spate of recent frauds has taken the sheen off India’s new tax regime,"India’s goods and services tax (GST) may not be as “good and simple” as it was purported to be.

A spate of frauds discovered recently has turned the spotlight on how businesses are exploiting the loopholes in the two-year-old taxation system.

The latest episode was reported last month when the top management of fruit juice maker Manpasand Beverages (MBL) was arrested for an alleged fraud of Rs40 crore ($5.8 million).

The alleged crime

On May 23, Abhishek Singh, managing director of MBL, his brother Harshvardhan Singh, and chief financial officer, Paresh Thakkar, were arrested following a raid by GST officials at the company’s headquarters in Vadodara in the western state of Gujarat.

The firm, which markets X-Cite, Mango Sip, Siznal, and Aprilla fruit juices, among others, allegedly carried out fictitious transactions with dummy entities to avail input tax credit.

This provision allows firms to reduce the levy on the sale of products if they have already made payments for the inputs purchased. MBL is accused of evading Rs40 crore in taxes in financial year 2019 by faking input purchases from 30 fictitious entities.

It is difficult for auditors to unearth such a long trail as there are no records available with the registrar of companies (RoC).

However, MBL’s is not a one-off case.

Other instances

In March this year, the Hyderabad central GST commissionerate discovered an alleged tax fraud of Rs224 crore—along with fake invoices of Rs1,289 crore—carried out by a group of eight iron & steel product-trading firms. Of these, only a few names were made public: VS Ferrous Enterprises, Bharani Commodities, Infinity and Hindustan Steels.

Investigators have linked these entities with Hyderabad-based Sujana group of companies. Some of them used illegal input-tax credit and GST returns as collateral to raise loans worth Rs700 crore from scheduled banks.

Apart from these, many instances of GST fraud by individuals have also come to light.

In February this year, a Bihar resident was accused of claiming fraudulent tax benefits to the tune of Rs800 crore. This is being dubbed as one of the biggest such cases.

A resident of Vadodara has, meanwhile, been identified as the mastermind of a scam involving fake invoices through which he claimed input-tax credit of Rs177.64 crore in January.

Fault lines

Introduced with much fanfare in July 2017, GST was touted as a simple, nation-wide taxation system to replace the various indirect levies. The new tax structure was aimed at higher transparency, and timely compliance.

However, these cases of fraud prove that even GST can be manipulated.

The GST council is now leveraging data analytics to detect anomalies in filings, besides gathering information on value of products, tax rates, tax amounts, sales and purchase details.",fake firms,"India’s goods and services tax (GST) may not be as “good and simple” as it was purported to be.

64,"In first use of power of arrest, IRAS nabs 10 in GST fraud","SINGAPORE — Over the past two months, tax investigators from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) arrested 10 members of a criminal syndicate suspected of perpetuating Goods and Services Tax (GST) carousel frauds.

IRAS said in a media release on Wednesday (13 November) that this is the first time it has exercised its newly-acquired powers of arrest, during raids conducted from 23 to 24 October, and 12 to 13 November.

The island-wide operations involved simultaneous raids on 36 business entities and 73 locations including Kallang Pudding, Tampines and Choa Chu Kang. About 200 electronic devices and business records were seized during the operations, while 41 individuals are assisting IRAS in investigations.

“The profile of tax evaders is changing. In the past, we investigated mainly businessmen who failed to report their income fully, or who claimed certain expenses not allowable for tax purposes. Today, we deal with more syndicated groups whose members may have been involved in past criminal activities,” said Lawrence Eng, assistant commissioner of IRAS’ Investigation and Forensics Division.

“Some suspects can be very uncooperative; they try to destroy paper documents or refuse to hand over evidence. With our new powers of arrest, our investigators can be more effective in bringing the perpetrators to justice.”

How carousel frauds cheat authorities

In carousel frauds, the same goods are traded through contrived supply chains which eventually result in the export of the goods. While these supply chains involve seemingly unrelated multiple companies, they are typically controlled by one mastermind.

SOURCE: IRAS More

For instance, Company A acquires the goods and then sells them to Company B charging GST on the supply of the goods. Instead of accounting and paying over the GST to IRAS, the director of Company A would go missing.

The goods are further sold to bogus businesses acting as “buffer” companies before they are finally exported. The exporter company would then claim input GST paid on the exported goods, which is effectively seeking a refund of the GST amount on a fraudulent supply chain – GST that the tax authority never received in the first place.

No goods may actually be exported

In some instances, no goods are actually exported and the business transactions are merely a paper exercise, with the sole aim of claiming fraudulent GST refunds.

There are also some cases where some of these supposedly exported goods are subsequently sold in the domestic market without GST, which gives the fraudsters an unfair advantage over other legitimate businesses which charge GST on the sale of their goods.

Anyone who commits the offence of wilful intent to evade or assist any other person to evade GST faces a penalty of up to three times the amount of tax undercharged, as well as a fine of up to $10,000 and/or a jail term of up to 7 years.

Hyderabad: The Ministry of Finance has said GST evasion to the tune of Rs 1,874.13 crore was found in Telangana from July 2017 to January 2020. According to officials, of this, about Rs 805.17 crore has been recovered from evaders after arresting 35 people in different cases in Telangana.

Prosecution was not filed in any case registered in the State, the Ministry said adding that efforts were on to curb evasion of GST with the help of inputs from the Directorate General of Analytics and Risk Management (DGARM). The Directorate-General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) and Central GST field formations are initiating various other measures in this regard including checking the evasion through e-Way bill mechanism and taking action on specific intelligence.

In all, 336 people were arrested in 36 States/Union Territories for evading tax and prosecution was filed in 31 cases. In Telangana, the GST officials booked cases against tax evaders especially industrialists. A few weeks ago, the DGGI has conducted searches at the residential premises of a film actress along with those who were into the chit fund, entertainment and infrastructure businesses. The premises of those extending financial services into fitness media were also raided in connection with the alleged evasion of taxes. The searches were conducted at 23 locations.

Apart from detecting tax evasion, officials cracked the whip on industrialists for their alleged involvement in fake invoices scam. Last month, the city zonal unit of DGGI arrested the director of a private limited company, who is also a Chartered Accountant, for issuing fake invoices worth Rs 69 crore.

68,"Rs 127 Cr GST Fraud Unearthed In Mumbai, Two Accused Sent To 15 Days Judicial Custody","On May 19, Amit Upadhyay, 40, and Asad Anwar Sayed, 42, were sent to judicial custody for 15 days by a local court in Mumbai. Upadhyay and Sayed had allegedly conspired to give effect to a Rs 127 crore tax fraud. The Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (DGGSTI) is estimating this fraud to be over Rs 300 crore, and, reportedly, has decided to contest the bail applications of the two accused.

It seems the duo had, allegedly, duped the government by wrongfully claiming GST credit of Rs 80 crores for non-existent services. Upadhyay’s company, Horizon Outsource Solutions Private Ltd, showed fake invoices raised by Sayed’s company, Best Computer Solutions Private Ltd, and then claimed GST credit for the non-existent services received. This also resulted in artificially boosting Horizon’s turnover, Rs 400 crore for FY 2016-17, enabling Upadhyay to leverage more funding.

As per reports, it also came to light that Horizon collected Rs 47 crore service tax in the period, April 2016 – June 2017, but did not deposit the money with the government.

As reported by the Hindu, sources in DGGSTI said, “Once the investigations are complete, we expect the total evasion to reach ?300 crore and more. We don’t expect them to go scot-free since it is a one-of-its-kind case. The invoices were not only generated on services never provided, but they were even printed.”

They have been charged under section 132(1) of CGST act for supply of goods or services without issue of invoices, issue of invoice without supply of goods, availing input tax using bogus invoice, and collection of tax but failure to pay the government beyond three months from the date on which such payment becomes due.

69,"Fake firms, fake invoices and credit fraud — how it went all wrong for GST in just 2 years","Text Size: A- A+

New Delhi: Bogus firms, fake invoices and fraudulent input tax credit claims have become the biggest headaches for the tax administration of the goods and services tax (GST) regime in just over two years.

So what went wrong with India’s ambitious indirect tax regime rolled out in July 2017 that was meant to create an electronic trail of all transactions through a seamless chain to make evasion difficult?

Several things: Failure of technology to act as a deterrent against evasion, initial lack of oversight and supervision, and non-existent tax return forms that would have helped in matching invoices and weeding out any fake transactions.

Tax evasion has been rampant since GST rollout, with various instances coming to light of taxpayers using ingenious methods to evade the indirect tax. Taxmen have uncovered many modus operandi and are aggressively using technology and existing data — from e-way bills and GST returns — to check evasion.

However, the extent has taken even the taxmen by surprise. After overlooking evasion for the first fiscal of GST to help taxpayers adjust to the new regime, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) started an enforcement drive that saw many tax evasion cases coming to the fore.

In 2018-19, the central GST authorities registered over 1,600 cases involving an amount of Rs 11,251 crore, as against 5 cases involving an amount of Rs 13 crore in the nine months ending 31 March 2018, CBIC data showed.

Until November 2019, over 6,000 cases were filed by the authorities, showing the increasing enforcement action being taken.

Now, the Narendra Modi government has initiated the process of scrutinising all refunds since 2017 using data analytics to look for cases of unscrupulous refund claimants or shell companies that are claiming fake input tax credit, said a finance ministry official who didn’t wish to be named.

Central GST collections estimated in the Union Budget 2019-20 were at Rs 5.26 lakh crore. However, until November-end, only around Rs 3.28 lakh crore was collected, data from the Controller General of Accounts showed.

Loopholes in the indirect tax regime

GST was introduced in 2017 as a singular indirect tax reform aimed at removing all barriers across states and unifying the country into a common market. It was also meant to create a seamless chain of transactions in which all transactions are documented and backed by invoices to prevent evasion.

A destination-based tax, the regime was designed in a way to levy a tax at the point of consumption. It allowed for seamless movement of input tax credit through the entire supply chain. So a manufacturer could claim credit for taxes paid while purchasing inputs and adjust it against the final tax liability on the sale of output.

However, the GST regime suffered its biggest setback when the technological network was unable to deliver.

The GST Council, the apex governing body for the regime, was forced to recommend one simple form called GSTR 3B, doing away with the need of invoice matching — a practice where invoices uploaded by the buyer have to match with the ones uploaded by the seller — for claiming credit.

The panel also put forms like the GSTR 2 and GSTR 3 — two forms that were initially part of the plans to verify transactional details uploaded by buyer and sellers — on the backburner.

This saw many evaders using this loophole to claim input tax credit without paying taxes and without any counter verification.

Sumit Dutt Majumder, former chairperson of the Central Board of Excise and Customs (now CBIC), said the original design of GST envisaged e-invoicing using which the tax paid and credit taken can be tallied at every stage.

“However, GST was started at a time when the technological system was not fully operational and not tested. It could not take the initial load and as a knee-jerk reaction an over simplified form GSTR 3B was introduced,” he said.

Added to this, to make the new tax system acceptable to all, a lax enforcement approach was followed, he added.

‘Mushrooming’ of fake firms and invoices

In the two years since the GST was rolled out, the CBIC has come across many modus operandi to evade taxes, three officials administering the central and state GST told ThePrint.

Under one of the most rampant ways, bogus firms are registered, fake invoices produced without any actual movement of goods and then these invoices are used to claim input tax credit fraudulently, said the officials.

Another method has been under-invoicing of transactions to reduce the tax outgo.

For instance, last year, the GST intelligence arm of the CBIC unearthed a fraud wherein one individual had created 90 fake firms and issued bogus invoices worth over Rs 7,000 crore with GST involved of around Rs 700 crore. These fake invoices and the resultant fraudulent input tax credit was then utilised by some bigger firms in the cotton yarn spinning industry to offset their tax liabilities.

“Most cases unearthed so far show that though there has been no actual movement of goods, fake invoices are issued and input tax credit claimed,” said a state GST commissioner of a southern state on condition of anonymity.

“Many non-identifiable entities mushroomed. They registered under GST using PAN of some random people and through issue of fake invoices, managed to claim bogus credit,” said a central GST commissioner who didn’t wish to be identified.

The central official pointed out that besides claiming input tax credit and adjusting them against the tax liability, there have been instances wherein exporters have used fake credit to pay duty and then claim a cash refund.

“In a few recent cases, the tax authorities found how so-called ‘star exporters’ were evading taxes and were non-traceable in their registered addresses. Moreover, these entities claimed huge amounts of refund in cash but had paid taxes of only a negligible amount in taxes,” he added.

In at least 9 such cases, investigations point out to fake invoicing and fraudulent tax credits which have been encashed through the facility of integrated GST (IGST) refunds. IGST is applicable to interstate transactions.

Tax evaders also found another way of claiming cash refunds against input tax credit. The GST law allows for a cash refund in the case of inverted duty structure — where the tax paid on inputs is more than the tax applicable on the final output.

In a case from last year, authorities found that a group of people created a network of 500 firms, including fake manufacturers of ‘hawai chappals’, across states, other intermediary firms and fake retailers to claim and encash fake credit. In this case, the raw material has an applicable tax rate of 18 per cent whereas chappals are taxed at 5 per cent. The group managed to create fake credit amounting to Rs 600 crore before the tax authorities cracked down.

Haseeb Drabu, former finance minister of Jammu and Kashmir, and the state’s representative in the GST Council meetings during the rollout, said, “Technology was the biggest let down.”

Technological constraints meant that GST was never designed to become a part of the business process, he said.

Other evasion instances involved taxpayers interpreting definitions to wrongly exploit lower applicable tax rates. For instance, branded products were passed off as non-branded products to claim lower rates.

“While some taxpayers try to interpret the various product definitions to reduce the eventual tax liability, there have been many instances where the practices adopted are outright fraudulent,” said a second central GST commissioner working in Mumbai.

Plans to deal with evasion

Majumder, however, said the introduction of e-invoicing and new GST return forms in the upcoming fiscal should help in curbing evasion.

“This means that the enforcement authorities do not have to worry about business to business transactions as these will be covered by e-invoicing but will have to look for ways for business to consumer transactions,” he said.

According to a deadline set by the Modi government, e-invoicing will be mandatory from 1 April 2020. The new GST return forms are also expected to come in effect from the next fiscal.

70,Rs 13 crore GST fraud busted after UP cops & sales tax dept’s joint raid in Lucknow & Noida,"Text Size: A- A+

Noida: The Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (STF) and the sales tax department have unearthed a Rs 13 crore tax fraud case involving two subsidiaries of a company which carried out the embezzlement by means of bogus invoicing, officials said Saturday.

According to officials, the accused firms, RoundPay Techno Media and RoundPay Voice Tech, both registered at the same address in Lucknow, were involved in e-payment for utility services.

They were involved in circular trading and had shown transactions worth Rs 72.7 crore between them, on which they claimed an input tax credit of Rs 13.09 crore at 18 per cent GST, a senior official said.

“The STF and the sales tax department were jointly entrusted with the responsibility to probe the case, a first of its kind operation in Uttar Pradesh. This trading module was studied for 45 days. It was found that their activities were being carried out in Lucknow, Pratapgarh, Noida and Khiri also,” Deputy Superintendent of Police, STF Noida, Rajkumar Mishra said.

“The firms were identified, their locations physically verified. Over 100 officers were involved in the operation,” he said.

Mishra said simultaneous raids were conducted at the locations of the main companies in Lucknow and their subsidiaries in other towns by five teams comprising personnel of STF field units in Lucknow, Allahabad and Noida.

“When the investigating teams asked the companies for an invoice of the trade done between them, they failed to produce any. The system which was used by these companies for generating the invoice/bills also had no record of this trade,” the officer said.

“The director of the parent company has admitted in writing to the probe agencies about the Rs 13 crore fraud,” the DSP said, adding 6 TB (terrabyte) data has been recovered from the firms’ servers in Noida and a detailed investigation of it was underway.

“The fraud amount is likely to go up, we are awaiting the details,” he said, adding Mishra said no FIR has been lodged as of now neither any arrest made.

71,"Govt paid input tax credit on Rs 4,000 cr fake GST invoices in 2018","This story is from April 27, 2019

NEW DELHI: The government is looking into a proposal from the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB) to bring fraudulent input credit tax, claimed by companies generating fake invoices of Goods and Services Tax, under the stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ) by making it a predicate offence punishable with rigorous imprisonment.

A proposal was recently floated by the CEIB which has said that in the previous financial year, till December 2018, input tax credit was fraudulently availed by creating fake GST invoices to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore.

This is just a small fraction of the actual tax evasion and money laundering using shell companies. Invoices generated without actual supply of goods to the tune of Rs 24,000 crore has been detected last year by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence, which has the mandate to look only into the central GST evasion.

The CEIB study says fraudulent claims of input tax credit at the state level could be larger. Invoices are generated without actual movement of goods and suppliers down the line claim input tax credit based on such fake invoices. Money earned through these fake transactions are actually black money and laundered by entities creating web of shell companies which have no real business activity.

Through the CEIB, the nodal agency for economic intelligence, the government monitors economic crimes across the country investigated by several revenue intelligence agencies such as the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Enforcement Directorate (ED), Directorate General of GST Intelligence, Income Tax, CBI and others.

Intelligence agencies are required to regularly share and update progress of their cases and probe details with the CEIB which further collates these data and provide inputs to other agencies for a coordinated action on fraudsters.

The fraudulent claim of input tax credit by suppliers based on fake GST invoices is contravention of Section 16 of the GST Act, which the agency has proposed to be made a predicate offence so that the ED or any other agency can book such entities under the PMLA and attach their properties and those of their associates.

Significantly, the CEIB has also linked many big banking frauds where thousands of crores of loans have turned bad with entities engaged in fake input tax credit using shell companies. Since these shell companies are merely paper entities with no real business activity or assets, banks find it difficult to recover losses.

TOI had reported earlier, that the CEIB has approached the finance ministry seeking orders from the revenue department to all other revenue intelligence agencies to share real time data and investigation updates on their cases to ensure that a coordinated action is taken against serial offenders and tax evaders.

73,"SGST department unearths Gujarat’s biggest fake billing scam worth Rs 6,030 crore","This story is from June 29, 2019

Picture used for representational purpose only

AHMEDABAD: Ever since the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST), Gujarat ’s biggest ever fake billing scam has been unearthed by the state GST (SGST) department. Some 282 firms have come under the scanner of SGST department to probe the scam that involved generation of bogus invoices to the tune of Rs 6,030 crore.

These fake bills were generated to fraudulently claim input tax credit ( ITC ). Estimated by the SGST department which indicate that taxes to the tune of Rs 910 crore have been evaded in connection with this scam.

The bogus bills so generated, were used to fraudulently claim input tax credit (ITC) without actual movement of goods. Explaining the modus operandi, commissioner of commercial tax PD Vaghela said, ""This is an organized scam where the kingpin has obtained GST registrations in the name of random persons like daily wagers, peons and labourers, among others. Using these registration, fake movement of goods is shown and bogus purchase invoices are generated. These bills are sold at a lump-sum amount to actual traders, who not just purchase goods from the grey market to claim input tax credit (ITC) illicitly but also evade taxes. Given the huge amount of fake bills generated, it was important to initiate immediate investigation into the matter, thus preventing further loss to the exchequer.""

The firms involved include 84 in Ahmedabad, 62 in Surat, 55 in Morbi, 17 in Bhavnagar, 16 in Vapi, 13 in Gandhidham, 10 in Rajkot, 9 in Gandhinagar, 7 in Vadodara and 9 in other parts of the state.

Department confirmed that the companies involved in tax evasion were largely into the business of metals, scrap of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, ceramics and chemicals. ""Most of the companies involved tend to fall under the 12% and 18% tax slab,"" said Vaghela.

""We have received several representations from trade and industry bodies to curb the menace of bogus billing scam,"" Vaghela added.

So far, the SGST department has nabbed some 15 persons, in connection with the fake billing scam and chargesheets have been filed against them. Some seven major fake billing scams have been reported in the state, till date, wherein bogus invoices worth Rs 3,434 crore have been generated to evade taxes to the tune of Rs 354 crore, said special commissioner of state commercial tax department Ajay Kumar.

Sources said that one of the reasons for fake billing scams was the mass-migration from Value Added Tax (VAT) regime to GST regime, wherein GST registrations were provided without physical verification .

Commercial tax department officials said that the tax evasion through fake billing scam was not just hurting the state exchequer but was also posing an unhealthy market competition for genuine companies that pay taxes regularly.

75,EOW books gutka manufacturers for Rs 1900 cr GST fraud,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh EOW on Thursday booked four directors of Kaipan Pan Products Private Limited for allegedly evading GST (goods and services tax) worth Rs 1900 crore through fraudulent means. EOW had raided business establishments of prominent pan masala and gutka manufacturers in Bhopal, Indore and Gwalior following complaints of massive tax evasion. Several child labourers were rescued during the operation, said officials.

“The timing of the raid was very important. We found labourers working at 4.30 am. What kind of shift is it? There were no records of stock, materials and labourers working at the unit. We have enough evidence to prosecute them,” said an EOW officer, wishing anonymity.

When contacted, EOW DG Sushovan Banerjee confirmed the action and said strong steps would be taken against those involved. the directors have been booked under section 420 (forgery), 120 (criminal conspiracy) of IPC or and 122 of GST Act.

Raids were conducted at factories of some of the top brands in Govindpura at around 4.30am. Separate teams had raided other gutka companies in Indore and Gwalior. The raid team in the state capital was led by EOW SP Arun Mishra. Ready stocks worth more than Rs 5 crore were found at these units. EOW had shortlisted these companies immediately after chief minister Kamal Nath ordered a crackdown last week.

On January 3, in his first meeting of the year with bureaucrats, CM Nath had said: “Shudh Ke Liye Yudh is a massive drive that is gathering popularity through public support. But there needs to be action against gutka and paan masala sellers, apart from cartels involved in the manufacture and supply of fake medicines.”

“Unaccounted’ packs are sent off to different destinations. They have 40 labourers only to load packs of gutka pouches in trucks, so you can imagine the amount of gutha that is produced and supplied from this factory alone.”

Knowing that the clandestinely produced gutka is loaded in trucks early in the morning, the EOW team raided the unit at 4.30am. As they detected more illegal activities — like child labour and mixing of tobacco in gutka— personnel from departments like labour, revenue, commercial tax, excise, central excise and police also joined the operation.

Officials said that the government has been trying to plug leakage of revenue from gutka and tobacco companies. Excise duty is calculated under ‘Pan Masala Packing Machines (Capacity Determination and Collection of Duty) Rules, 2008’, modified in 2010, and ranges from Rs 14 lakh to Rs 77 lakh, depending upon the price per packet of pan masala (non-tobacco) and production capacity of machines. For flavoured supari, the tariff is charged on MRP and duty is calculated at 2.36% per packet, excluding 35% abatement.

It is alleged that the companies have been under-reporting the capacity of their machines in collusion with a section regulatory officials. Company officials tried to argue that some of the machines were not in use. “Each and every machine was in use when the unit was raided. Number of labourers made it clear that the production was being under reported,’ said the EOW officer, adding that mismatch has been found in the declaration and production capacity of machines.

77,Two Maithan Ispat employees arrested for 'GST fraud' in Odisha,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Representative image.

BHUBANESWAR: Two top executives of Maithan Ispat Limited , a subsidiary of MESCO Steel, have landed behind the bars for allegedly availing Rs 23 crore input tax credit (ITC) without possessing supporting documents, including tax invoice. Goods and service tax (GST) officials on Monday said they arrested Maithan Ispat’s assistant general manager (taxation) Surendra Patra and general manager (finance) Manas Ranjan Padhi on Thursday for allegedly masterminding the fraud.

Directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI) recently received information about the alleged tax fraud and started investigating against Maithan Ispat Limited, located at Kalinga Nagar in Jajpur district. “We found that the Maithan Ispat Limited availed fictitious input tax credit between April 2018 and November 2018 without due support of relevant documents, like invoices. They took inflated ITC in their GST return without receipt of any goods and services. They had no requisite documents to claim the ITC,” DGGI’s additional director in Bhubaneswar, Santosh Kumar Mohanty said.

Recently, the GST officials raided Maithan’s factory and office premises at Jajpur and found evidence of the alleged tax offence. The officials detected that the company illegally applied for Rs 23 crore ITC while filing GST return from April 2018 to November 2018 and fraudulently claimed the money as their GST liability. GST authorities said the alleged mischief of the company allegedly caused a loss of Rs 23 crore to the government exchequer.

""Our further investigation revealed the involvement of Surendra Patra and Manas Padhi, the two employees of Maithan Ispat Ltd, behind the manipulation. Efforts are being made to recover the government dues along with the interest and penalty,” Mohanty said. The GST officers arrested Patra in Bhubaneswar and produced him in the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate. Padhi was arrested in Kolkata and produced in the court of ACJM, Sealdah in Kolkata. Both the accused were remanded to 14-day judicial custody. Maithan Ispat authorities were unavailable for comment.

80,GST intelligence investigates Panjab University for Rs 38 lakh fraud,"This story is from November 3, 2019

INCOME FROM AFFILIATION FEE: The directorate general of goods and services tax intelligence has issued a notic... Read More

CHANDIGARH: Panjab University is being probed by the directorate general of goods and services tax intelligence (DGGI)-a wing under the finance ministry- for allegedly evading service tax of around Rs 38 lakh between 2013 and 2017.

The university allegedly did not pay any service tax on the fee it collected from colleges for granting them new affiliations, extending their ongoing affiliations and so on. It also did not pay any service tax on the fee it collected from students at their coaching centre for IAS and other competitive examinations.

The DGGI found PU's income from the above sources to be Rs 2.86 crore, which attracted a service tax of Rs 38.66 lakh.

A notice issued by the DGGI to PU reads: ""Intelligence gathered by the officers of DGGI, Chandigarh zone, indicated that PU is engaged in granting affiliation activity to colleges in Chandigarh and in Punjab, for consideration in the form of application and affiliation fee, continuation fee, temporary extension of affiliation fee, permanent affiliation etc. It is also engaged in providing coaching to aspirants of IAS and other competitive exams but was not paying any service tax on the amounts so collected.""

PU argued that the fee was charged to colleges to defray the expenditure involved in carrying out inspections by the university, processing and examination of various documents, which are required to ascertain whether the concerned college fulfils the conditions of grant of affiliation as prescribed to ensure maintenance of quality and standards in higher education.

""Since such fees from colleges are collected in relation to regulatory functions of the university, which are integral part of system of education. In our view such considerations are not subject to levy of service tax,"" PU said.

The DGGI notice, however, maintained that collection of affiliation fee by PU was taxable service as it does not ""appear to be covered"" under the entries mentioned in the negative list of education related services exempted from service tax, nor was it a part of auxiliary education services exempted from service tax.

Further, the DGGI, citing section 65(27) of the Finance Act , stated that PU was also bound to pay service tax for running the IAS centre since it was a commercial training/coaching centre being run to help aspirants compete in various national and state-level examinations.

""Thus, it appears PU has contravened the provisions of sections 67, 68, 69, 70, 91, 95, 115 and 161 of the Finance Act, as it failed to assess and discharge its service tax liability, failed to file its returns correctly, and failed to pay secondary and higher education cess, Krishi Kalyan Cess and Swachh Bharat Cess on the taxable services,"" the notice stated.

It also said that PU was liable to pay interest on the amount of service tax not paid by them, besides various penalties under the sections of the Finance Act it violated.

In reply to the notice, PU registrar Karamjeet Singh wrote that they deny all the allegations ""which are incorrect and based on the wrong appreciation of facts.""

The reply maintained that services provided by educational institution in respect of education were exempted from service tax. ""Since PU is solely engaged in imparting education and the affiliation fee charged is directly relation to its main objective, which is to impart education, the affiliation fee is exempted from service tax,"" the reply stated.

It requested the department to drop the proceedings against the university and grant them personal hearing.

HYDERABAD: Sleuths from GST’s intelligence wing investigating fake invoice fraud have found that companies in Telangana generating fake invoices to get tax benefits generated most invoices during the assembly and Lok Sabha elections — between November 2018 and May 2019. Besides tax benefits, the companies have also been accused of indulging in circular trading without actually supplying goods and services.

In the past fortnight, directors of three infrastructure companies, two subcontractors for irrigation projects and others in road construction have been arrested by Director General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) sleuths.

Among them are Akella Sai Kumar, director of Aaria Projects Private Limited; D Naresh Choudary managing director of DNC infra; and D Sriharicharan of Suave Corporation India Limited. They are lodged in Chanchalguda jail in Hyderabad. Together, they are believed to have defrauded GST of around Rs 50 crore.

Officials have pegged the DNC fraud at Rs 28 crore. Initial investigation into the other two companies has put the collective liability at Rs 21 crore.

KOLKATA: A fake GST racket, where invoices were issued without actual supply of goods, was busted by officers of Central GST, Kolkata North Commssionarate, on Friday. Four persons, including two chartered accountants, were arrested and produced in the court of CJM, Alipore . They have been remanded in judicial custody till June 10.

The CGST officers found that the accused were allegedly involved in issuing fake invoices primarily valued at Rs 721 crore and the racket had consequently caused a loss of Rs 98.7 crore to the government exchequer.

The probe revealed that the organization had set up base in the Burrabazar area and kept in touch with some CAs. When some businessmen approached the CAs for fake invoices, they were directed to the middlemen who charged a hefty commission to provide the invoices. The accused offered common people interest-free loans and other financial benefits in lieu of their KYC details. These details were then used to set up fictitious companies to issue fake invoices.

Officers said the role of other persons are also being investigated with a focus on beneficiaries of fake credit.

According to commissioner of Kolkata North CGST, D Nagvenkar, the estimated loss is likely to increase as more detections come to light. The commissioner emphasised that no one should divulge KYC details to unknown persons for a small gain.

The highest ITC—that of Rs 101 crore—was claimed by another fake firm, named Exacom Enterprise, an officer said. “The investigation report is yet to arrive from other parts of the country, but it is estimated that the ITC collected on false claims would be around Rs 500 crore,” the department said in a petition filed with the ACJM court.After the CJM court rejected anticipatory bail plea of an accused person, the department arrested Bagla and his associates, Vishnu Kumar Singhania, Rajiv Kyal and Sandip Kyal.

95,Issuing fake bills for refunds: 4 city firms raided for GST fraud,"Ludhiana: Directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI), New Delhi, raided four city-based companies suspected of being hand in glove with a Delhi duo who fleeced government of crores of rupees by claiming fraudulent IGST (integrated GST) refunds.

Sources said these companies provided bills to the firms of the accused duo on the basis of which they claimed fraudulent refunds worth crores. The total IGST refunds availed by the duo’s companies were of Rs 61.02 crore.

Sources said raids in this case were being conducted simultaneously in Delhi, Ludhiana, Baddi and other cities since March 6. Teams of more than 50 officials, including those from Ludhiana zonal office, were parts of the operation.

“DGGI had raided four Delhi-based firms on March 6 on information that these were engaged in the business of availing fraudulent input tax credit (ITC) for payment of IGST on export of goods. These four firms have claimed forged IGST refund of more than Rs 61 crore. The department also conducted raids on some companies located in Ludhiana and Baddi that were connected with the four firms of Delhi duo, as they were providing them bills. On the basis of these bills, the Delhi firms applied for fraudulent ITC,” sources said.

Officials are still assessing since when the Ludhiana firms started the malpractice.

Source said the raiding party also had instructions to raid a house in Ludhiana that belonged to the owner of a raided firm, but sleuths were unable to do so due to a death in the family of the businessman. The businessman is likely to be summoned to Delhi for further questioning.

The bill network

On March 6, DGGI (headquarters) had registered a case against Delhi-based Aastha Apparels Pvt Ltd and three other firms. The firms fraudulently claimed ITC on the basis of invoices received from non-existent/ non-functional companies or from those that have indulged in circular trading. The said firms also did not have commensurate purchases backwards. The supplier companies were controlled and managed by only a few persons and they were also engaged in claiming IGST refunds. These companies have created a complex web of circular trading among themselves without commensurate payments or actual supplies of goods to pass on ineligible ITC to the exporters. As a result, two directors of these exporter companies were arrested on March 7 under the CGST Act. Subsequently, officials began to probe the role of suppliers and others associated with these exporters.

MEERUT: In a major operation against firms which availed fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC) under Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, the sleuths of Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), Meerut Zonal Unit conducted searches at multiple locations in Delhi, Mumbai, Raipur, Varanasi and Moradabad unearthing a major scam of fake invoices without supply of goods by a group of people to defraud the government revenue.

DGGI sources said that they did it by way of encashment of fraudulent ITC availed on fake invoices through IGST export refund route. Chartered accountant Gaurav Jindal, 27, has been arrested for allegedly running the racket. He was sent to Meerut jail for the offence on Tuesday.

Elaborating on the matter, senior intelligence officer Devender Kumar said, “These offenders created multiple companies/firms using either their own PAN card and voter id; or in the name of family members and employees of their firm solely for the purpose of fake billing without supply of goods. One such exporting firm involved in the said racket is GJA Industries ltd, Delhi, which is being controlled and managed by Jindal. During interrogation he accepted his involvement in this case and was arrested on Monday.”

During searches it was found that these firms issued fake invoices of more than Rs 210 crore in value thereby passing on and cashing on input tax credit of about Rs 50 crore illegally.

“Interestingly these companies or firms are not engaged in normal business activities as they neither have any godowns for storage nor they receive or supply goods. They wrongly availed ITC without actual purchase of goods in their firms/companies and encashed the same by issuance of export invoices and claiming IGST refund thereon from customs,” said DGGI intelligence officer Aishwarya Atri.

DGGI, Meerut Zonal Unit alone has detected more than 60 cases involving duty evasion of more than Rs 250 crore and recovered Rs 121 crore in the past one year.

MEERUT: The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) sleuths arrested a businessman from Kotdwar in Uttarakhand for fraud of Rs 20 crore.

On Thursday, he was produced before the special court in Meerut and sent to 14 days judicial custody.

According to sources, the businessman was fraudulently availing input tax credit by showing purchases via shell companies.

“On February 3, our teams had conducted raids on three firms located in Kotdwar. These were Uttaranchal Iron and Ispat Pvt. Ltd., PL Steels, and Kanhaiyaji Concast Pvt. Ltd., in which they found a GST fraud worth Rs 20 crores. In this connection, the director of PL Steels and Kanhhaiyaji, Mukesh Kumar, was arrested on Wednesday. On Thursday, he was produced before the GST court in Meerut and was sent to 14 days to judicial custody,” Manish Goel, additional director general, DGGI, told TOI on Friday.

Goel said there are several other companies on the radar at the moment.

Notably, this is the second raid conducted in the recent past. Last month, a similar raid took place at Poddar Ispat Pvt Ltd, in which the officials unearthed a GST fraud of Rs 10 crore.

This is not the first time that fraud of invalid input tax credit has come to the fore. In March last year, the DGGI sleuths had arrested Rajesh Goyal, 42, a resident of New Panchwati colony Ghaziabad, for issuing fake invoices of more than Rs 400 crore from around 50 shell companies.

MUMBAI: Central Goods and Services Tax ( CGST ) officials have arrested a 36-year-old director of a metal trading firm in a Rs 10-crore GST scam .

The Thane wing of the CGST arrested Vinit Agarwal, director of Hemraj Devkarandas Metals and Minerals Ltd, for availing Input Tax Credit to the tune of Rs 10 crore by submitting fake invoices. Sources said CGST officials arrested Agarwal after the sessions court rejected his anticipatory bail plea.The court, while rejecting his application, held that in view of the total tax evasion, merely depositing Rs 2.19 crore would not help Agarwal get pre-arrest bail.

The CGST had carried out searches of Agarwal’s residence as well as warehouses and office in Kandivli, Borivli and Kalamboli in Raigad district and seized several documents.

Agarwal had claimed ITC on invoices issued by firms without receiving any goods.

MUMBAI: A pharmaceutical company’s director, who allegedly opened 17 fictitious firms and availed of input tax credit (ITC) of Rs 158 crore, was arrested by Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) authorities on Wednesday.

The Mumbai unit of CGST arrested Pravinkumar Prajapati, director of Sulabh Pharmaceutical Pvt Ltd, for fraudulently availing the amount with fake invoices and without receipts of goods or services. ITC is an option that allows taxpayers to claim credit for taxes paid on purchase.

CGST officials had recently searched the firm’s office in Malad and found GST violations. During investigation, it transpired that Prajapati had opened 17 firms, controlled by him and his family.

“Prajapati had done many paper transactions without supplying goods and caused a huge loss to the exchequer,” said an official, on condition of anonymity.

“This was done to inflate the turnover of Sulabh, Dhruv Wellness Ltd, and Jayesh Lifescience Pvt Ltd and fraudulently avail of inadmissible ITC. All the companies operated fully or partially by the accused would issue invoices among each other in a circular manner to avail and pass on inadmissible ITC,” added the official.

101,Daily wagers held in Rs100 cr fake GST bills case; probe on to reach mastermind,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Nagpur: Three daily wagers have landed in the taxman’s net in an intricate GST evasion racket allegedly involving fake transactions of over Rs100 crore.

The names of the three were used to run allegedly dummy firms, created solely for the purpose of tax evasion. An operation by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGSTI), against a steel trading firm, has led to the arrest of two workers and a driver engaged in this concern. The mastermind, who is still at large, is also being tracked down, said sources. The arrests are part of a larger operation against the firm, in which tax evasion trails run to Punjab and Haryana.

The arrested trio has been identified as Ramprasad Borkar, Mohammed Sheikh and Nehar Bopche. Their income and living standard do not match the transactions undertaken in their names, said sources, but entire deals happened in their names. Bound by the law, the three — whose names and signatures were used in the transactions — had to be arrested. The law calls for arresting the person in-charge of a business where an alleged tax fraud or evasion is found. This was the three labourers in this case, since they were at the helm on paper, said a source.

Further investigations revealed that the papers, including Aadhaar cards of the three, were collected by the alleged mastermind in the name of getting Know Your Customer (KYC) formalities done. Instead, documents related to three firms were prepared using their identification papers, said a source. The three are expected to file police a complaint against the alleged mastermind for misuse of their documents.

The firms created using their names are Baba Enterprises, Bhawani Enterprises and Karan Steel. One of the firms did not exist at the given address, and addresses of the other two turned out to be low-end residences.

It is learnt that the firms were used to generate fake invoices for both purchase and sale of goods, which ultimately led to availing of input tax credit, even by firms located as far away as Punjab and Haryana, said sources.

According to preliminary investigations, fake invoices worth Rs108 crore were unearthed by the sleuths leading to input tax credit of Rs9.75 crore.

The DGGSTI has come across a number of fake invoice cases for availing ITC, leading to arrests. ITC is a reduction available from the final liability in proportion to the tax paid at the time of purchase of inputs for making the end-product. ITC can be used to clear the overall tax liability too.

102,"Firms using fake GST invoices to jack up turnover, get more loans","This story is from September 6, 2019

Picture for representational purpose only.

Nagpur: The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGSTI), which recently made a number of arrests in cases of fake invoices, has also found that the prime objective of the persons arrested was not to evade tax but to fudge balance sheets and secure higher loans. In most cases, GST liability arising out of the alleged fake transactions was also discharged, said sources.

The sleuths have come across cases of circular transactions through a maze of companies spread across the country. The fake invoices generated as sales by the originating firm — generally a shell company — came back to it, in the form of fake purchases at the end of the cycle.

The issue was discussed in a meeting of senior level officers in the department over a week ago. An internal circular has already been issued, directing field offices to flag off such cases to banks from where such firms have acquired loans or applied for credit.

For example: X, an originating firm, invoices for goods worth Rs100 crore. It also pays Rs10 crore GST element arising out of the deal. The goods are never supplied anywhere, and only invoices are raised. The receiving company continues the chain and issues invoices by selling the same fictitious goods to another entity after value addition. The second entity claims the ITC on tax paid at the time of purchase, and also pays tax due on value addition. This goes on.

The chain spread throughout India, including Nagpur, finally ends at the originating company or its subsidiary. The same fictitious goods that were sold at the start of the chain are purchased back by the first company through fake invoices, and the entity also claims ITC or even refunds.

Since the transactions have cut across states, the first company also gets a chance to claim integrated GST (IGST), refund on accumulated ITC, when the chain ends. IGST is charged on inter-state transactions, in which refund can be claimed on surplus credit. The GST field offices have been also directed to report the amount of IGST refund claimed to the finance ministry on account of these revelations.

“Recording sales in the books through fake invoices shows higher turnover, which helps the firms secure loans for higher amounts than that they are entitled to. The value of the fake goods also get multiplied in the chain,” said a source.

“Those in the chain don’t mind paying the taxes since the objective is not to evade taxes but secure loans. However, such loans are prone to turn into bad debts for the banks. Once the case is confirmed beyond doubt, the banks are also being warned,” a source in DGSTI said.

A couple of arrests were made in such cases at Nagpur too. It has been found that the shell companies from where the deals originated are in centres like Ahmedabad, Surat and Mumbai. Even as the deals originated from shell companies, the chain passes through firms that are also into genuine business, said a source.

103,"First arrest in GST scam at Nagpur, co director absconding","This story is from August 20, 2019

Nagpur: The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGSTI) made the first arrest in the Nagpur region on Monday. The case involves a larger probe into an alleged scam of issuing fake invoices to the tune of over Rs600 crore in all, enabling businesses across the country to claim wrongful input tax credit (ITC) from the GST liability.

Pawan Lal, an accountant in M/s New Age False Ceiling Pvt Limited located at Kalmeshwar, was arrested by the sleuths here. A company director, Manoj Gupta, is at large and a search is on, said a press release issued by the directorate.

So far around 400 arrests have been made throughout the country in similar cases, with this being the first in Nagpur region of DGGSTI that covers Vidarbha, Marathwada, Nashik and Khandesh. The company was found to have taken fraudulent ITC to the tune of Rs4.63 crore based on 133 fake invoices, said the press release.

Every indirect tax system, including GST, has an element of ITC, in order to prevent cascading effect of taxes. Under this, each entity gets a proportionate reduction in tax liability for the tax paid at the time of purchase of raw material, or while availing of any service that goes as input into making the final product or service.

The taxmen have come across a number of cases of wrongful ITC being claimed by assessees on the basis of fake purchase invoices. It is learnt that sleuths have come across a couple of companies at Mumbai that were only engaged in issuing fake purchases invoices for others to claim ITC. Even New Age False Ceiling was found to have got invoices from the same sources.

The company that issues such invoices records the transactions as sale in its GSTR 1 returns. The other firm records it as purchase of inputs and claims ITC for tax paid on purchases. Since the company that issues fake invoices also records it in its GST returns as sale, it further claims ITC by getting fake invoices from elsewhere.

In this case, a circuitous transaction was found between the Mumbai companies and firms to which the invoices were issued. The same firms were found to have later sold back the material after some value addition to the Mumbai companies, enabling them to avail ITC. However, transactions from both ends were found to be fake, said sources.

104,"GST: Fake invoices worth Rs 10,000 crore unearthed","This story is from January 25, 2020

Nagpur: With searches carried out in different parts of the country, the directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGSTI) has unearthed cases of fake invoices worth over Rs 10,000 crore in the current fiscal.

The main purpose of the DGGSTI raids was to probe fraudulent claims of input tax credit (ITC), leading to GST evasion. However, tax sleuths have also found that in 35% of the cases, fakes invoices were issued to fudge up the turnover with no GST evasion. This has helped many firms to avail bank loans for which they may not have been eligible in the normal course given their actual financials.

In a sizeable number of invoices, no ITC was availed through the fake invoices but it either led to avoiding income tax on the basis of recording fraudulent purchases in the books or at the other end it helped in bloating the turnover. Fakes invoices were used as a mode to route unaccounted funds too.

The DGGSTI is now taking up the job to sensitize the income tax department and even banks about such cases. There have been cases where firms with poor financials have been able to get huge loans on the basis of fake entries and have later turned NPAs, said A K Pandey, special secretary to the ministry of finance and member of Central Board of Indirect Tax and Customs (CBIC). He was in the city for an official visit.

He said a system of directly issuing invoices through the GST-network (GSTN) is being worked out too. There are chances that it may be implemented in a few months as the fine tuning of the plan is under way.

With this, the sale and purchase invoices of a business having a turnover above a certain limit may have to be directly generated through the system. This will ensure easier matching of the purchases and sales of the opposite parties, he said.

Huge mismatches have also been found in the GST liability calculated by an assessee in the GSTR1 returns and the amount paid through the GSTR3B format.

GSTR 1 is a record of sales and GSTR3B is a summary return on the basis of which a final liability is discharged. At times, low sales, compared to that mentioned in GSTR1, is shown in GSTR3B by the same assessee.

Cases of mismatch over Rs 40 crore may be handed over to the DGGSTI which is a specialized investigation wing whose officers have all India jurisdiction. The rest of the cases will be taken up by the respective commissionerates, he said.

105,Rs825cr fake purchases used to claim Rs148cr GST input credit,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Nagpur: An investigation conducted by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence’s (DGGSTI) Nagpur zonal unit has uncovered rampant practice of availing fraudulent input tax credit (ITC), by issuing fake e-way bills. This is in line with similar cases found in other states too.

A search conducted into the accounts of 58 business firms showed that fake purchases worth Rs825 crore were recorded to claim ITC to the tune of Rs148 crore. It was found that 10,000 fake invoices were issued to avail the ITC. The tax sleuths have arrested four persons in the case. Some of the accused are absconding, said a press release issued by the DGGSTI. The sleuths conducted searches at 75 places in this case.

ITC is a crucial component in an indirect tax system like GST. This is a proportionate reduction available in the tax liability for the levy that has been paid at the time of purchase of inputs. For example, the tax paid at the time of buying raw material is deducted while calculating GST on the final product. This is done to prevent cascading effect of tax.

The tax sleuths scrutinized each of the e-way bills to detect the fraud. It was found that the vehicle numbers mentioned in the e-way bills were merely two or three-wheelers in many of the cases. An e-way bill is proof of transport of goods from the seller to buyer’s end. The transaction cannot be validated without an e-way bill.

In order to record fake purchases in the returns and claim ITC, fake e-way bills were issued. There was no transit of goods but to validate the claim fake invoices had to be generated, said the source. The vehicle numbers were of automobiles that were not meant for commercial transport. The registration numbers of random vehicles were quoted in the e-way bills, said a source. In a large number of cases the vehicles did not even exist, the source said.

This is part of a quarterly investigation carried out by the DGGSTI. The figures are expected to further increase as the probe proceeds further.

PATNA: The intelligence wing of the commercial taxes department (CTD) has unearthed tax evasion worth Rs 96 crore by 25 fake firms operating from various parts of the state. The next step would be initiating penal action against them, department sources said on Friday.

The CTD intelligence wing had dedicated itself to unearthing such firms during the lockdown , the sources said, adding that it was an exercise undertaken to zero in on the firms which indulged in illegal activities and tax evasion. The process would continue and the profiling of such firms would be a continuous exercise.

The CTD sources also revealed that legal and administrative proceedings would be started for initiating penal action against the 25 fake firms which indulged in interstate sales and purchase of goods on a big scale — with their merchandize valued at Rs816 crore — by generating e-way bills.

The department sources also said even as they generated e-way bills, they did not file goods and services tax (GST) returns. The probe into their activities revealed that they had also violated the GST rules and norms.

Further, these 25 firms did interstate sales and purchase in items like iron and steel, coal and bitumen. They were not located to anyone city or town in the state, but operated from all across Bihar , sources said, adding they also indulged in bogus bill trading. Further, these firms existed only on paper.

“The intelligence wing of the state CTD utilized the lockdown period in tracing their identities and tracking their illegal activities by using the Data Analytics and Human Intelligence methods,” a source said.

Now that the lockdown has been lifted, penal action would certainly be initiated against them. The sources maintained that the profiling of fake firms and their shady activities would help in checking tax evasions, besides creating suitable business and trade atmosphere in which honest traders would be able to conduct their activities honestly abiding by the GST norms.

114,Businessman arrested in fake input tax credit case,"The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has arrested a Delhi-based businessman for issuing fake invoices that were then used to claim input tax credits by the those who received those invoices.

Under India’s Goods and Services Tax regime, tax does not have to be paid on the same material multiple times.

In other words, when person A sells a piece of cloth to person B and pays tax, then person B does not have to pay tax on the value of the cloth when he or she makes a dress out of the cloth and sells it to person C. This is called input tax credit, as the input has already been taxed at the hands of person A.

In this case, Nitin Jain gave the credit of the taxes he paid to others so that they could lower their tax liability to that extent. It is not clear from the finance ministry statement whether Jain actually paid the taxes and fraudulently passed on the credit for others to ‘reuse’, or whether he did not even pay the tax.

“During investigation it was revealed that Nitin Jain has issued bogus invoices through his firm M/s Shiv Trade Incorporation and another firm M/s Om Trade Inexim, opened in the name of dummy person, of various types of goods namely ferrous/ non-ferrous scrap, ingots, nickel cathode etc. amounting to Rs 268.3 crores (approx).

“Through bogus invoices, Shri Nitin Jain has fraudulently passed Input Tax Credit (ITC) amounting to Rs 41.6 Crores (approx). This ITC was further availed by various entities to offset their GST liability and also passed on such fraudulent ITC to further buyers who availed the same to discharge their GST liability against their outward supplies with an ulterior motive to defraud the Government exchequer.

“During the course of investigation Shri Nitin Jain also admitted of having issued bogus invoices in lieu of certain fixed commission,” the ministry said in a statement.

He was charged under Section 132(1)(b) & (c) of the Central Goods & Services Tax Act (CGST), 2017, which are cognizable and non-bailable offences and punishable under Section 132 of the CGST Act, 2017.

Jain was arrested on 12th February, 2020 under Section 69(1) of the CGST Act, 2017 and produced before Judicial Magistrate in Gudgaon on the same day.

The court has sent him to judicial custody for 14 days.

121,Is Manpasand Beverages among the biggest corporate frauds in India?,"When Dhirendra Singh, Chairman, Manpasand Beverages (MBL) approached Mumbai-based financial services company Finquest Financial Solutions for a Rs-100 crore funding in May this year, he was in dire straits. His company was accused of GST (goods and services tax) fraud and his son Abhishek Singh (the company's Managing Director) and CFO, Paresh Thakkar were put behind bars. The company had also not been paying its staff for many months despite reporting a revenue turnover of Rs 1,078 crore and a profit of Rs 69 crore in 2018/19. Singh urgently needed to pay Rs 18-odd crore to the GST Council to free his son and CFO.

However, after signing on a term-sheet with Finquest, Singh filed a criminal complaint against Bharat Patel, Chief Mentor, Finquest Financial Solutions and his partners, accusing them of a hostile takeover bid. Singh is also known to have alleged that Finquest didn't release the money that was promised to him in four instalments of Rs 25 crore each. In an interview with Business Today, Patel said that his term sheet always said that they would first do the due diligence and then give the money. ""That was part of my loan agreement. We also said that a professional management will run the show till our money is lying there.""

Patel claims that he had released Rs 12-odd crore as employees' salaries were to be paid.

""When we went to the company we found out to our utter shock (EY had done the due diligence) that the turnover of the company was Rs 144 crore and not Rs 1,078 crore. From various sources we came to know that there were three sets of books in the system. All employees depended on just one person (CEO Dhirendra Singh) and were involved in managing or fudging the books. This was a red alarm for us.""

As per the EY Report, there is a significant difference between the sales figures as per the tally software and MBL software, which is a customised ERP system being used by the company for recording the production, purchase and sales/dispatches. While the tally data showed the sales to be around Rs 1,078 crore in FY19, the sales of the company as per MBL software amounted to a measly Rs 144.39 crore. ""They were fudging their accounts,"" says Patel. ""We were worried of the state of affairs of the company, we were worried about the profitability it could earn because the 20 per cent margins that was shown to us was nowhere in sight. It was nothing more than 8-10 per cent,"" he further adds.

Patel says that his audit firm advised him to do a forensic audit and claims that Singh refused to join the meeting when the report came. Singh, however, has filed a criminal complaint accusing Finquest of a hostile takeover. ""The meeting was done on a conference call and he just switched off the phone. The conduct of the meeting was not conveyed to the exchange, which we did,"" claims Patel, who refers to this incident as one of the biggest scandals post Satyam where promoters happened to manipulate the market.

Though the Manpasand scam came to light only this year, Mumbai-based 2Point2 Capital had raised a red flag about the company way back in 2016. The investment company in a blog had said that it had done a telephonic survey of over 100 retailers across the states of Gujarat, Punjab, UP, Uttarakhand and Bihar, which revealed that less than 10 per cent of the retailers carried Manpasand's products. The blog had also raised questions about the company's claims of generating a substantial part of its sales from the Indian Railways (IRCTC) vendors. Its flagship beverage, Mango Sip, in 2016, was classified as a Category A supplier by IRCTC, while Maaza, Slice and Frooti were classified as category A special suppliers, which meant that Manpasand was not allowed to sell its products on premium trains. The blog had said that its research did not match with the market share numbers that the company had projected.

The blog had also raised questions about the market share of Fruits-Up, which the company had claimed had a higher market share than Parle Agro's Appy Fizz, when the former was only present in Gujarat and Maharashtra.

""The company had not disclosed information as part of their IPO and QIP filings, which even the bankers had ignored. The promoter had not disclosed that his brother was running a competing business, which is supposed to be the part of the QIP filing, points out Amit Mantri, Co-Founder, 2Point2 Capital Advisors. The investment firm in 2016 was considering investing in Manpasand. ""On paper it looked attractive. A beverage company which had marquee shareholders and Deloitte as its auditor, but when we did a forensic analysis on it, we realised it is a scam,"" says Mantri.

Manpasand, over the last couple of years, has seen the exit of three audit companies - Deloitte, Mehra Goel & Co and Batliboi & Purohit. Deloitte had exited as audit partner because they did not receive requisite information they needed to perform the audit.

123,GST fraud: Fake bills used to claim input tax credit worth Rs 450 crore,"The GST-Intelligence Unit has unearthed a racket which used fake bills to claim input tax credit worth Rs 450 crore, the Financial Express reported today.



The government has started issuing summons to those traders or business houses that produced counterfeit bills to claim tax credits.







In one such notice, the intelligence unit has asked the traders to provide evidence of transactions - sale/purchase - truthfully and produce the documents and record for the examination. The authority has estimated the value of the fictitious purchases at Rs 2,500 crore and the undue gain out of this around Rs 450 crore at an average GST rate of 18 per cent, the report said.







This is not the first case of GST fraud using fake sale/purchase invoices. Ever since the new taxation system came into force, numerous cases of fake input tax credit has been reported.







This year in February, the Haryana Excise and Taxation Department lodged a police case against a Gurugram-based firm for acquiring fraudulently an input tax credit of Rs 50.34 crore.

In March, the Punjab Excise and Taxation Department booked 134 persons from 70 firms for their alleged involvement in Rs 100 crore fake invoice scam.







In a separate case, the CGST-Mumbai Commissionerate arrested two directors of a private company for fraudulently availing input tax credit of Rs 7.2 crore.







In May, the GST Intelligence arrested two persons in Kolkata for the tax evasion of more than Rs 40 crore.





On Monday, the Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax intelligence or DGGI arrested three persons in Rajasthan for tax evasion of Rs 58 crore.



Providing the details of the case, Additional Director General, DGGI Jaipur, Rajendra Kumar said: ""The accused generated bogus invoices through companies that existed on papers for availing input tax credit. The goods were not issued by the firms"".

According to the report, traders buy fake bills which enable them to claim input tax credit on the supply which never happened. Input tax credit is an option in the GST which allows the taxpayers to claim credit for the taxes paid on purchase.Last week, the GST Department arrested two persons - Amit Upadhyay and Asad Anwar Sayed - in Mumbai for allegedly defrauding the exchequer of Rs 127 crore by issuing fake GST invoices and not paying the service tax. According to a report in the Hindu, the GST Intelligence Unit is estimating this fraud to go over Rs 300 crore. If that happens, it will be one of the biggest evasion cases in GST history.In all these case, modus operandi is almost same. First, fake invoices were issued for sale and purchase that never happened on ground. Misuse of input tax credit is a serious concern for tax authorities as it seems to have created a hole in the system that the enforcement agencies are struggling to fix.

To deal with rising input credit frauds, the GST Council has adopted invoice matching mechanism which is expected to be rolled out on July 1. According to the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the invoice matching mechanism will curb the possible tax evasion on account of fake invoice frauds.

Last year in September, the Central Board of Excise and Customs asked its officials to verify all transitional credit claims for more than Rs 1 crore.

124,"GST officials arrest 3 in Delhi for floating 17 fake companies, invoices","GST officials have arrested three persons involved in floating 17 fake firms and wrongfully availing credit on taxes paid on input worth Rs 436 crore by issuing fake invoices.

Officers of the Central GST Delhi East Commissionerate detected that the fraudulently availed input tax credit by these firms was used to file refund claims to the tune of Rs 11.55 crore, an official statement said.

""During the investigation, it came to light that a major Hawala operation was being run by the accused persons in connivance with certain bank employees (under investigation),"" the statement issued by CGST Delhi East said.

During the investigation, it was found that the 17 firms existed only on paper and had been floated for passing on input tax credit by generating fake invoices. The three accused -- Asif Khan, Rajeev Chhatwal and Arjun Sharma -- were arrested on March 1 and remanded to judicial custody till March 13.

The trio, operating a total of 17 fake firms, procured invoices without actual supply of goods and availed and passed on input tax credit fraudulently to the tune of Rs 436 crore.

126,Gaming GST- Business News,"Ranchi-headquartered 'Baba Rice' is a household name in the eastern part of India. Even though it's not a premium Basmati brand, an average consumer in Jharkhand or adjoining Odisha would prefer it to national brands such as Daawat or India Gate as is evident from the 70 per cent marketshare Baba Rice enjoys in the region. Yet, parent Baba Agro Foods recently rolled out the same rice under another brand 'Ranchi Gold'. Intriguingly, while Baba Rice is priced at Rs 2,640 per quintal, Ranchi Gold is just under, at Rs 2,610. Why? Baba Agro Foods Chairman Yogesh Kumar Sahu says the marketshare of Baba Rice has eroded 10 per cent since the arrival of GST in July 2017. Ranchi Gold was his desperate defence mechanism.

'Baby Doll', 'Babuji', 'Apple' and even 'Kakaji' are just a few rival brands that mushroomed and undersold Baba Rice by circumventing GST. While branded commodities such as rice, atta and dal are subject to 5 per cent GST (commodities in the pre-GST era did not attract tax), white label products can escape GST.

Flip the packs of any of these brands, and they carry a disclaimer: ""We hereby voluntarily forego... all types of actionable claim or enforceable right in respect of brand name printed on this bag."" According to GST norms, unbranded commodities need to package their products in white packs and mention the company's name along with the FSSAI number at the rear of the pack. ""This is a grey area which most companies are capitalising on. Nowhere in the law is it mentioned that it is illegal to pack in a branded pack with a disclaimer,"" explains Sahu. Since these brands don't pay GST, they are cheaper than branded commodities. Ranchi Gold exploits this loophole. Sahu claims there has been an uptick in volumes since Ranchi Gold was launched in September. ""I have covered up some of the lost ground, but I still have more to do,"" he adds.

As expected, branded commodities have taken a hit. Krishnamohan Kumar, a wholesaler of foodgrains in Durgapur, West Bengal, confirms that there has been a 60 per cent dip in sales of branded commodities: ""Even established brands such as Daawat have come up with non-GST options."" Hemant Malik, CEO, ITC Foods, maker of Ashirvaad Atta, had expressed concern in an earlier interview with BT over the entry of a huge number of local brands that were biting into Ashirvaad's market share by ducking GST.

Since GST's launch, the government has been playing a painful waiting game, hoping for a jump in collections to shore up indirect tax revenues. However, flagging collections have dashed all hopes of higher revenues from capitalising on digitisation and formalisation via GST.

Flagging GST collections means lower Central revenues and even higher fiscal deficit. Not to mention that the tussle with states will intensify. Collections averaged Rs 82,294 crore per month in 2017/18, Rs 98,114 crore per month in 2018/19 and Rs 100,646 crore per month so far this fiscal against a target of about Rs 1.1 lakh crore per month. India is likely to end fiscal 2019/20 with an overall GST shortfall in excess of Rs 1 lakh crore. The GST Council has to look no further than segments such as these for answers to why India's GST collections have failed to take off.

Not only have traders and businesses found ways to circumvent the tax, 'cash-only' value chains operating without invoices have managed to stay out of the GST network from end to end. Under-invoicing is rampant, and unregistered dealers have avoided GST calling it too complex. Some companies are exploiting layers of subsidiaries to fool the law.

Unregistered Dealers

Walk into a neighbourhood store in Indore, Varanasi, Udaipur or any non-metro city and town and ask the store owner about GST compliance. The immediate response would be in the affirmative. Probe a bit, however, and the owner would invariably say he is an unregistered dealer, which means that he earns less than Rs 40 lakh a year, and so does not need to register with GSTN. But distributors of large FMCG companies whisper that these neighbourhood stores earn much more than Rs 40 lakh a year, but don't want to declare their income in order to circumvent GST. Anuj Agarwal, owner of a kirana store on the outskirts of Indore, is brave enough to admit that he avoids GST. ""It's too confusing and expensive. I don't know how to claim input credit, so I might as well not declare my income."" Agarwal largely sells unbranded commodities such as rice, atta, sugar and dal, for which he doesn't need to have a GST number. His store also has everything from biscuits and snacks to floor cleaners and detergents, but most of them are local brands. ""These brands themselves don't pay GST, so, I am safe,"" he smiles.

Manu Misra, a wholesaler of leading FMCG brands in Varanasi, says that post-GST, sales of large brands have nosedived and his business has gone down by 30 per cent. ""Smaller retailers prefer selling local brands so that they dont have to pay GST. Moreover, local brands are cheaper and offer more quantity."" Misra adds that he too has started buying non-GST brands to bridge the gap due to the fall in sales of bigger national brands.

This explains why HUL Chairman Sanjiv Mehta said in one of the quarterly result meetings that consumption in the rural markets has reduced drastically. Apart from lower spending power due to slowdown, GST has also had a negative impact on branded consumption.

Fake Entities

Many businesses are using layers of subsidiaries to evade GST. Vadodara-headquartered Manpasand Beverages has allegedly conducted sale and purchase of its products across 30 'fake' entities and indulged in a Rs 40 crore fraud. Real purchase and sale transactions were shown with values getting inflated with each transaction in order to claim a cumulatively larger amount of input tax credit. The company was already in the eye of a controversy as its audit partner, Deloitte, had resigned stating Manpasand was not being transparent about its business. The GST fraud led to the arrest of the MD and CFO of the company.

A grain wholesaler (speaking on condition of anonymity) in Hisar, Haryana, with a monthly turnover of Rs 1.5 crore, has three entities and all of them report a turnover of less than Rs 40 lakh per year and hence don't come under the GST ambit. ""I had to do it because I can't afford to hire chartered accounts and invest in e-filing systems. My cost would have gone up by Rs 25 lakh per year and my margins would remain the same,"" he says.

A partner of a leading consulting firm explains a more blatant way of using multiple layers of subsidiaries to evade tax. ""Say, a business has six group companies. Each sells to the other company. The company with the highest sales closes down and vanishes. It files a winding up petition, which costs just Rs 12,000. If the tax department comes knocking at its doors, the promoter asks the department to file its claims with the liquidator. It is a good legal safeguard for just Rs 12,000,"" he says.

Fake Exports

Fraudulent businesses are inventing even more innovative ways to evade GST. ""Often, those who buy goods in cash do not insist on pukka bills. These bills are then sold to entities that export goods. Instead of exporting genuine goods, they export miniature or fake versions, and claim input credit,"" says a Delhi-based lawyer.

This September, the Ahmedabad unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence unearthed a scam where 'exporters' claimed Rs 400 crore input tax credit on fake bills worth more than Rs 1,000 crore. The scam involved 20 Noida-based exporters of manufactured tobacco and related goods. Since these are sin goods with tax incidence of 93-188 per cent, the scope to claim input credit increases manifold.

These exporters would source low-grade tobacco products from local markets in Delhi at the rate of Rs 150-350 a kg and export them to units based in Kandla SEZ in Gujarat by over-invoicing them at the rate of Rs 5,000-9,000 a kg. The fake bills produced by the exporters were sourced from 25 suppliers from Assam, UP, Bihar, Delhi, MP and Haryana. These suppliers are either non-existent or controlled by the exporters themselves.

With increasing incidences of fake exports invoices, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) had earlier this year identified exporters who were perceived to be risky on the basis of pre-defined risk parameters. The department identified over 5,000 such risky exporters in June as against about 1.42 lakh total exporters. Refunds to these risky exporters are released after verification of their input tax credit claims within a maximum of 30 days.

Rajat Mohan, Partner in chartered accountancy firm AMRG & Associates, says that in some cases input tax credit has been delayed for six months. He cites an example of an auto-spare parts manufacturer in Delhi who has not received input tax credit refund because he has been identified as a risky exporter.

Invoice Tinkering

Among the most popular ways to avoid GST is to tinker with invoices. This takes four forms: cash-only or invoice-less deals to avoid the GST network entirely; under-invoicing; over-invoicing; and fake invoices.

Crawford Market in Mumbai is a popular destination to shop for home interiors. At the time of billing, the salesmen insist that the consumer pay in cash and not ask for an invoice. Consumers agree as they then get a better deal. Generating a bill would attract GST, making the goods expensive by 5-18 per cent.

Similarly, a steel rod manufacturer confides that maximum input credit theft happens in the steel sector - via over-invoicing. Steel rods used for construction attract 18 per cent GST. ""To manufacture 1,000 kg, the producer needs 1,200 kg of raw material. He over-bills to show that he used 1,400 kg of raw material and gets input credit on that,"" the manufacturer explains. ""The biggest advantage I have is that no one can make out the quantity of raw material I have used to manufacture the rods,"" he says, adding that he also buys bills to use to claim input credit. ""Fake bills are easily available. Over-billing is the only way I can cover up losses I make in the market. The economic slowdown has hit the real estate market badly.""

In Ludhiana, India's bicycle manufacturing hub, violating GST through under-invoicing and claiming input tax credit on fake bills is rampant. Onkar Singh Pahwa, CMD, Avon Cycles, says the organised bicycle industry has shrunk by 3-5 per cent, while the unorganised sector is flourishing with a robust 15-20 per cent growth per annum. ""There is a 12 per cent GST on bicycles. These people are under-invoicing heavily. If the bicycle costs Rs 2,000, they under-invoice for Rs 1,000 and are then able to offer the Rs 120 GST benefit that they get to the customer,"" explains Pahwa.

For price conscious consumers, savings from unbranded options is an attraction. K.B. Thakur, Secretary General, All-India Cycle Manufacturers Association, says large-scale GST violation has led to a trend of reverse FDI in India with many cycle manufacturers considering moving their manufacturing base abroad. The GST Commissionerate of Ludhiana recently raided the premises of 12 manufacturers who were ducking GST.

The next modus operandi exploits the loophole that GST Network cannot match invoices before giving input credit. As a result, unrelated invoices of different transactions are being bought at 1-2 per cent commission. For instance, by selling invoices of an item or service that attracts 18 per cent GST of, say, Rs 500 crore, one can make Rs 5-10 crore. These are invoices of different buyers, but are unrelated for the person claiming input credit. Most often, suppliers of these invoices have no businesses at all. At present, input credit is paid on a provisional basis as there is no mechanism to match invoices. The verification is possible only after both the supplier and the buyer file GSTR-3B?. The buyer of these invoices can claim input tax credits of 18 per cent or Rs 90 crore (on Rs 500 crore). This happens mostly in the B2C segment where goods are sold in the market without issuing pukka bills to customers and these bills are then sold to businesses who then claim ITC (input credit).

In the monsoon session of Parliament, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had admitted that frauds related to claiming fake input tax credit in GST have been rampant. Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey also admits that the quantum of GST evasion detected is significant on a month-on-month basis. ""The GST Council has a crucial role (to play) in curbing evasion through various measures, including legislative and administrative, besides use of technology. Tax evasion can be effectively curbed through robust sharing of data, exchanging (information) on modus operandi, and following best practices mechanism between the Centre and state GST administrations on a regular basis through institutionalised arrangement, etc.""

Around 11,456 GST fraud cases worth Rs 53,000 crore have been registered so far. In fact, claiming input tax credit against fake invoices is becoming one of the most common ways of defrauding the system. Between July 2017 and September 2019, around 5,650 cases of fraudulent input tax credit amounting to Rs 19,494 crore had been registered.

In September this year, CGST (Central Goods and Services Tax) Delhi West and CGST Delhi North in a joint operation busted a racket of invoices being issued without actual supply of goods. The masterminds had availed fraudulent input credit for seeking IGST (integrated goods and services tax) refunds for which they had created dummy companies. They had applied for IGST refunds from various ports across India and Rs 18.09 crore had indeed been credited to their bank accounts for this.

The Crackdown

Sushil Kumar Modi, convenor of the group of ministers on Integrated GST, recently said the government is closely monitoring around 67 lakh new registrants to ensure these are not shell or fake companies. He said they account for only Rs 10,000 crore or only 15 per cent of the total GST paid.

GST Network (GSTN), the entity that offers the IT support to the GST system, has come up with a new way to check refund fraud. Under the new return filing system, which will be implemented from April 2020, if a supplier doesn't pay taxes for more than two months, the purchaser will not be able to claim input credit from the third month. At present, one can claim input tax credit even if the supplier has not paid taxes for six months.

In the current system, GSTR-1 return has all the information of sales made by a supplier, while GSTR-2A has all the purchases made by a buyer. Entries from GSTR-1 of the supplier auto-populate the GSTR-2A of the buyer. GSTR-3B is the monthly return that every registered GST payer has to file. It has details of sales and purchases made.

Prakash Kumar, CEO, GSTN, says: ""Today, there is no linkage between GSTR-1 (filed by supplier) and GSTR3B (filed by all GST payers). A supplier can file GSTR1, and it would show in the buyer's GSTR2A. So the buyer can claim input credit by showing his GSTR2A even if the supplier has not filed GSTR3B and paid taxes. In the new system, if the supplier has not filed, it would show in the ANX-2 of the buyer (an annexure to GSTR-1, which has supplies details, and which the recipient has to accept/reject/mark pending).""

However, says Kumar, those who want to defraud the system can still do so for two months. ""We are working on how to plug this gap as well. This is a game of cat and mouse, they (those who want to game the system) would find a way out.""

Kumar says that even in the EU, GST (VAT) refund is a huge problem. ""This (refund fraud) is an intrinsic problem because the buyer can claim refund based on his purchases. But if the supplier vanishes, what can the buyer do. This is what the buyer says in the court. Our effort is to keep on informing the buyer that this is what the supplier has done,"" he explains.

Bibek Debroy, Chairman, Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, suggests mandatory registration for even small companies. ""This is of course a call that the GST Council has to take, but in my opinion, every MSME must take a GST registration, even if it is in zero tax (category). Second, the average GST rate is too low and most people would not want a 28 per cent rate nor a zero per cent rate, but a standardised rate. It means average rates coming down, and violations going down. You must fix it. GST Council will decide when and how to fix it. However, when growth rates are low, it is probably not the best time to do it. The third thing is to take a relook at the idea of compensation to states as it is a perverse incentive to states to have more and more rates at zero per cent.""

To ensure better compliance, the government has now started a new system wherein if a taxpayer is not filing GSTR-3B for two consecutive months, the facility to generate e-way bill gets automatically blocked. Once the taxpayer has filed one of the pending returns, the facility to generate e-way bill will be automatically restored.

""This lacuna is now being sought to be addressed by the new return mechanism which has features of matching, and also e-invoicing, both of which are slated for roll-out in the next fiscal. People used to take input tax credit fraudulently with fake invoices, but now it will not be possible for them to generate e-Way bills anymore,"" says Revenue Secretary Pandey.

In November this year, Central GST Delhi North Commissionerate unearthed a racket involving supply of invoices without goods and goods without invoices. The accused was found operating 10 fake firms that were created to rotate money and fraudulently claim input tax credit. Fraudulent input tax credit of Rs 140 crore was claimed using invoices involving an amount of Rs 1,040 crore.

Unfriendly Environment

Are Indian businesses averse to paying taxes? Life has become complicated post-GST, says Deepak Maru, a former President of Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ""Most businesses here are small and to handle GST complications, they will need a chartered accountant and a lawyer. Most of them can't afford that,"" he says.

Yudhishthir Bhatia, who owns a kirana store in Udaipur, says that the penalty he has to pay for being GST compliant is an additional expense of Rs 10,000 per month to hire a chartered accountant. ""My costs are going up but not my income is not.""

Maru says that most business owners in his region don't understand how to avail input tax credit, and neither do they know how to get a GST number. ""There are a lot of issues with input credit. My money is with the government as credit and they take their own time to pay me back. But if I am late in filing my GST return by even a day, I am charged a penalty."" He says that one of the reasons for the current liquidity crisis is because input credit of a lot of businesses are yet to be reimbursed.

Corruption and under the table dealings are at a peak in the GST era, say many business owners. ""It's not that people were not corrupt earlier but the intensity has increased manifold. The government has to do something to improve the ease of doing business,"" says Sahu of Baba Agro Foods. ""Why can't the government impose GST at sourcing itself? That would have solved our woes to a large extent,"" he says.

While Baba Agro Foods pays Rs 1,600 per quintal for paddy, competitors pay Rs 1,580, as they pay cash. The supplier is happy to deal with them as he also prefers cash. This leaves Baba Agro Foods in a weaker position.

S.C. Ralhan, CEO of Ludhiana-based Sri Tools Industries, which manufactures and exports welding tools, says, the only way to reduce GST theft is tax rationalisation. ""At the higher level (of bureaucracy), there is hardly any corruption, but it is very difficult to stop corruption at the lower level. Rationalisation of taxes is the best solution to avoid GST evasion.""

In the wake of growing revenue concerns, the GST Council is likely to revamp the tax structure. The move is likely to increase the government's tax collection. The answer may, however, lie in plugging the loopholes in the existing GST policy, and preventing businesses from circumventing India's most promising indirect tax.

127,Now a new GST filing system to curb input credit frauds,"GST evasions and input tax credit (ITC) frauds are rampant and the government seems unable to curb these practices. Although it has tried many ways to keep a check on the GST evasion, tackling ITC claims on fake invoices is being hard.

The GST Network (GSTN), the entity that offers the IT support to the GST system, has now come up with a new way to deal with the rampant ITC fraud.

Under the new return filing system, which is going to be implemented from April 1, 2020, if the supplier doesn't pay taxes for more than two months, the buyer will not be able to avail ITC from the third month. Today, one can claim ITC even if the supplier has not paid taxes for six months.

Prakash Kumar, CEO, GSTN, says: ""Today there is no linkage between GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B. A supplier can file GSTR-1, and it would show in the buyers' GSTR-2A. So the buyer can claim input credit by showing his GSTR-2A even if the supplier has not filed GSTR-3B and paid taxes. In the new system, if the supplier has not filed return and paid taxes, it would show in the ANX-2 of the buyer.""

In the current system, GSTR-1 return has all the information of the sales made by a supplier, while GSTR-2A has all the purchases made by a buyer. Entries from GSTR-1 of the supplier auto-populate the GSTR-2A of the buyer. GSTR-3B is for monthly returns that every registered GST payer has to file. It contains details of sales and purchases made by a business.

In the new system, GSTR-1 would be replaced by Annexture-1 (ANX-1), GSTR-2A would be replaced by ANX-2 and GSTR-3B would be replaced by Return (Ret) -1/2/3.

However, he says that those who want to defraud the system can still do it for two months. ""We are working on how to plug this gap as well. This is a game of cat and mouse, they (those who want to game the system) would find a way out.""

128,Budget 2020: Government to use AI to crackdown on GST frauds,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Budget speech was laced with poetry. At times, even the prose sounded poetic. Sample this: ""We wish to open up vistas for a vibrant and dynamic economy with a gentle breeze of new technology.""

That ""gentle breeze"" includes data analytics, machine learning, robotics, bio-informatics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), among others. The government proposes to, or is already harnessing these technologies for efficiency, surveillance, and better distribution of subsidies.

Here's what Budget 2020 tells us.

FULL COVERAGE:Union Budget 2020

""Dynamic QR-code is proposed for consumer invoices. GST parameters will be captured when payment for purchases is made through the QR-code. A system of cash reward is envisaged to incentivise customers to seek invoices. Deep data analytics and AI tools are being used to crackdown on GST input tax credit, refund and other frauds and to identify those trying to game the system. Invoice and input tax credit matching is being done wherein returns with mismatch of more than 10 per cent or above a threshold are identified and pursued,"" Sitharaman said.

AI for better stats: There is a growing need for the Indian statistical system to meet the challenges of real time monitoring, the Minister noted. ""Data must have strong credibility. The proposed new National Policy on Official Statistics would use latest technology including AI. It would lay down a road-map towards modernised data collection, integrated information portal and timely dissemination of information,"" she added.

Machine learning in healthcare delivery: Machine learning and AI will be used for delivering the Ayushman Bharat scheme. Health authorities and the medical fraternity can target diseases with an appropriately designed preventive regime, Sitharaman said.

Digital connectivity: This is not new but is still worth mentioning. The Minister said that all public institutions at gram panchayat level such as anganwadis, health and wellness centres, government schools, PDS outlets, post offices and police stations will be provided with digital connectivity. ""So, Fibre to the Home (FTTH) connections through Bharatnet will link 100,000 gram panchayats this year. It is proposed to provide Rs 6,000 crore to Bharatnet programme in 2020/21,"" she announced.

Digital platform for IP: More details are awaited on this. Sitharaman said India needs to expand the base for knowledge-driven enterprises. ""Intellectual property creation and protection will play an important role. Several measures are proposed in this regard, which will benefit start-ups. A digital platform would be promoted that would facilitate seamless application and capture of IPRs,"" she noted.

SINGAPORE: A 46-year-old man was sentenced to six weeks' jail on Thursday (Aug 2) for evading more than S$30,000 in Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2005 and 2006.



He was also ordered to pay a penalty of more than S$92,000, three times the amount of tax undercharged, to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS).

Sng Kay Heng, the accomplice of mastermind Eric Chia Puay Yeoh's complex GST scam using multiple shell entities, was handed the sentence more than a decade after investigations first began in 2007.

Chia, who had three accomplices and defrauded the Government of almost S$1 million, was jailed for 15 months in 2014 and ordered to pay a penalty of more than S$1.2 million.



Sng, the sole proprietor of general wholesale trade firm Strikey Trading, made false entries in GST returns for his company on three occasions in late 2005 and early 2006, resulting in the undercharging of tax by a total of S$30,806.61.

He had help from Chia in falsifying documents to make fraudulent claims in his GST returns for his business. Chia altered purchase and sale invoices originally issued to another company to reflect the name of Strikey Trading.

Investigations revealed that the suppliers reflected in the invoices did not make any sales to the company.



PROSECUTION ASKED FOR 14 WEEKS' JAIL

IRAS senior tax prosecutor Patrick Nai asked for Sng to be jailed for at least 14 weeks, saying that there was significant public interest in ensuring that those who deliberately evade tax are dealt with severely.

""If not for the IRAS investigation officers' efforts to uncover the offence, the accused would have cheated the tax authorities, a government institution, of S$30,806.61,"" he said.

He added that Sng was ""often quick to push the blame to his accomplice Chia"" throughout the trial and ""did not show any remorse"".

However, Sng's lawyer asked for a one day jail sentence, saying that his client had cooperated with IRAS and the authorities by attending all interviews from 2007.

He added that there has been a delay of 12 to 13 years from the commission of the offences, and said that this delay ""is inordinate and unfair to Sng"".

Sng, who now works as a part-time taxi driver, has been ""gripped by anxiety for 12 to 13 years"", said the defence.

""His social life was affected. His friends left him when he told them about the investigations, and his girlfriend left him,"" he said.

""This court cannot ignore that there has been such a delay,"" said the defence. ""This has to be one of the longest cases in which there is prosecution.""

In handing down the six weeks' jail sentence, magistrate Yan Jiakang said that even though Sng had stayed out of trouble, there had been no evidence of rehabilitation.

Sng's lawyer said his client intends to appeal the sentence.

For evading GST, Sng could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined up to S$10,000, on top of a penalty of up to three times the tax undercharged.

Justine Ibbetson has been found guilty of unlawfully lodging 10 false business activity statements overstating One Zero’s GST credits and refunds owed.

In addition to jail, Ibbetson was also ordered to pay back the money she received, $200,553, back to the Australian Taxation Office.

Ibbetson also attempted to obtain $55,413 in fraudulent refunds, which was denied following the result of an audit into One Zero’s tax affairs.

“We have no tolerance for blatant fraud like we have seen in this case,” ATO acting assistant commissioner Shane Strong said.

“Those who are caught deliberately trying to cheat the tax system can expect to feel the full force of the law, including large fines and even jail time.

“Tax fraud is not a victimless crime – those who engage in this criminal behaviour are effectively stealing from the pockets of taxpayers and obtaining an unfair advantage over those who do the right thing.”

In a report from Sunshine Coast Daily, Ibbetson allegedly claimed higher GST refunds than she was entitled to across a 13-month period starting from March 2014. The proceeds were allegedly used to sustain a gambling and alcohol addiction following a breakdown in Ibbetson’s marriage.

135,"Vijay Gutte, director of ‘The Accidental Prime Minister’, held for Rs 34 Cr GST fraud","Mumbai: Filmmaker Vijay Ratnakar Gutte, who has directed the upcoming film 'The Accidental Prime Minister', which stars Anupam Kher as ex-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has been arrested for alleged Goods and Services Tax (GST) fraud of over Rs 34 crore, a GST department official said on Friday.

Gutte was arrested by the Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence or DGGSTI on Thursday and produced before a metropolitan magistrate court in Mumbai which remanded him in judicial custody till August 14, he said.

""Gutte has been booked under section 132 (1)(c) of the CGST Act, which pertains to 'wrongful availment' of input tax credit using bills and invoices that have been issued without any supply of goods or services,"" the official said.

According to the official, Gutte's firm, VRG Digital Corp Pvt Ltd, allegedly procured 149 fake invoices involving GST of Rs 34.37 crore for animation and manpower services received from another company, Horizon Outsource Solutions Pvt Ltd.

In May this year, the DGGSTI had arrested the director of Horizon Outsource Solutions for an alleged GST fraud.

The agency's probe into the case revealed that Gutte's firm was one of the top clients of Horizon Outsource and was shown as receiving services of about Rs 266 crore with a GST implication of Rs 34.37 crore, even as there was no actual supply of services, the official said.

According to the rules, in cases where the amount of tax evaded or the amount of input tax credit wrongly availed or utilised, or the amount of refund wrongly taken exceeds Rs 5 crore, the accused is liable to be fined and imprisoned for up to five years.

The agency claimed Gutte's firm wrongfully claimed a cash refund of Rs. 28 crore from the government against Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT) credit received for these fake invoices since July 2017.

The agency said Gutte not only availed non-existent input tax credit or ITC, but also fraudulently claimed refund of the ITC from the GST department on the basis of fake invoices.

By doing so, Gutte and his firm defrauded and caused loss to the state exchequer, it said.

Gutte has so far produced three films - 'Emotional Attyachar', 'Time Bara Vait' and 'Badmashiyaan'.

136,Fake GST invoices: 4 held for losses worth Rs 385 crore,"Four persons including a chartered accountant have been arrested by the Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax (GST) Intelligence, Bengaluru Zone, in a case of fake GST invoices.

The accused were involved in issuing GST invoices without supplying goods, which leads to wrongful utilisation of Input Tax Credit (ITC).

According to the directorate, the accused had issued invoices worth Rs 2,364 crore which resulted in an ITC worth Rs 385 crore, causing losses to the government.

Documents found during searches conducted by the directorate indicated that some leading infrastructure companies operating in Bengaluru, Huballi and Kalaburagi benefitted from the fraud by using the illegal ITC.

This reduced the tax liability of these companies, which were payable in cash as per GST norms.

Based on intelligence, the directorate officials searched several businesses and residential premises in Bengaluru and New Delhi, following which the arrests were made. The arrested persons had created several bogus entities and registered them under Central GST Act, 2017, using PANs, electricity bills, bank cheques, photographs of their family members, employees and friends. This was used to generate transactions on paper, without actually supplying any goods or services.

Meanwhile, two of the arrested were found to be complicit in a clandestine supply of fast moving consumer goods without issuing any invoices. The duo also simultaneously indulged in issuing invoices to some other customers without supplying any goods and passed on these illegal ITCs, according to the directorate.

During the searches carried out on the accused, a total of Rs 3.02 crore was seized from residential premises, which were linked to such transactions. 22 bank accounts pertaining to various taxable persons involved in the entire nexus was unearthed by the officials.

140,"Bogus invoices aid in GST evasion of Rs 8,000 crore","The finance ministry's revenue department has detected fake invoices involving GST evasion of Rs 8,000 crore in the fiscal 2018-19. After registering nearly 2,000 cases, tax sleuths have managed to recover Rs 736 crore.

Data from the ministry shows that 1,959 cases of fake invoices were filed by taxmen in the last financial year.

Tax evaders use fake invoices to show supply of goods and services when none has taken place. Some cases relate to GST non-payment on invoices issued by traders, as per the department.

Cases have come to light where businesses ineligible to get input tax credit (ITC) avail false credit, falsify exports and claim refunds on it.

Currently, 241 cases are under inquiry, of which 136 pertain to non-filing of income tax returns.

Rampant falsification of invoices by businesses has pulled down government revenues. In June, GST collections dipped to Rs 99,939 crore after staying above Rs 1 lakh for three months.

With the indirect tax target for the current fiscal at Rs 13.71 lakh crore, the government needs to collect at least Rs 1.14 lakh crore per month.

""The issue of fake invoices continues unabated even under the GST regime. A new return form to be introduced in October, which will help match invoices of the seller and the purchaser, will largely take care of the sham. Next step is to move on to electronic invoicing,"" said Shashi Bhushan Singh, former member, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs.

The ministry will launch e-invoicing on a pilot basis from January 1 to replace conventional paper-based system of hard copies. Under the pilot, businesses above a specific threshold will have to generate e-invoice for business-to-business sales.

The ministry is also carrying out a Know Your Customer (KYC) exercise for companies to detect tax leakage.

141,Over 5k 'Risky' Exporters Identified for Fraud in GST Return,"June 20, 2019 4 min read

What was being considered a setback has unravelled a series of fraudulent filings on GST returns by exporters. So far, the government authorities have identified 5,106, what are being called ""risky” exporters for claiming GST refunds based on bogus invoices. Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) would now manually check their claims before issuing refunds.

Recently, in addition to the automated process of refunds for exporters under goods and services tax (GST), the indirect tax department had introduced manual checks to curb large-scale tax evasion after multiple instances of availing “integrated GST refund using fraudulent input tax credit (ITC) claims by some exporters,” were observed by various authorities.

Risk & Mitigation

According to CBIC, some exporters were declaring a much higher value of exports in their GST returns compared to the value mentioned in the shipping bill. Since exports are zero-rated, the exporting firm gets back the entire Integrated GST (IGST) paid on the export. Reportedly, such fraudulent claims of IGST refunds by exporters could exceed INR 1,000 crore.

CBIC has instructed its Customs and GST formations to verify the correct availment of input tax credit (ITC) by few exporters who are perceived as “risky” on the basis of pre-defined risk parameters. The new verification exercise is apparently aimed at preventing unscrupulous exporters from defrauding the exchequer and bringing a bad name to the larger exporting community.

Not Much of a Threat

Unlike what is being portrayed, CBIC has assured no threat to the exporters’ community, claiming that only 3.5 per cent of the total exporters were found “risky”. “Only 5,106 risky exporters have been identified so far as against about 1.42 lakh total exporters,” the statement read, further declaring that only 1,436 Shipping Bills filed by total 925 exporters have been interdicted.

Considering that about 20,000 Shipping Bills are filed by roughly 9,000 exporters on a daily basis, the intervention is negligible. Noticeably, even for the risky exporters, the exports are allowed immediately but the refund would be released only after the verification of ITC, which will be a maximum of 30 days.

The genuine exporters would continue to get their IGST refunds in a timely manner and in a fully automated environment, CBIC stated. Notably, India has been progressing on the exports front. The nation’s overall exports (Merchandise and Services combined) in April-May 2019-20* are estimated to be $92.33 billion, exhibiting a positive growth of 4.32 per cent over the same period last year.

Impact on the Industry

GST as a regulation was promulgated with the aim to simplify ‘ease of doing business’ by rationalising documentation, increasing the speed of commercial transactions and most important – to enhance the country’s image internationally. However, as is observed with every facility, it is open to either good use or intentional misuse.

Expressing his concern over the malicious usage of taxes, Sunu Mathews, MD, LEAP India Pvt Ltd provided, “Misuse of input tax credit is a serious concern for tax authorities as it seems to have created a hole in the system that the enforcement agencies are struggling to fix.”

Today export houses, mostly MSMEs, are subject to rigorous scrutiny which can negatively impact their ability to respond to their customers thereby adversely affecting the business. Mathews is of the view that the authorities should find a practical and robust mechanism to ensure that such malafide practices are eliminated and honest taxpayers are not impacted by this malaise.

Agreeing to him, Archit Gupta, Founder & CEO ClearTax, suggested, “Exporters have to exercise extreme caution in making sure there is proper documentation and shipping bill matches with GST Return values for smooth IGST refund. Such instances lead to heightened scrutiny for businesses.”",NA,"So far, the government authorities have identified 5,106, what are being called ""risky” exporters for claiming GST refunds based on bogus invoices.

Painting all exporters with the same brush is unfair and damaging: Sharad Kumar Saraf, President, FIEO

Reacting to the report published in some of the Newspapers on 6th January, 2020, Mr Sharad Kumar Saraf, President, FIEO said that it is very unfortunate that exporters have been singled out for GST frauds. Like any other section of the society, observed Mr Saraf, there could a fraction of exporters who might have misused the GST refund facility. It will be very unfair to subject the entire exporting community for serious checks and investigation based on alleged misuse by limited few.



FIEO Chief said that exporters have Import Export Code Number based on PAN and Bank Accounts. They have obtained GST Registration through KYC cross verifying their email and Mobile number. The status holders have submitted the CA certificate certifying the specified exports while claiming the coveted status. Due diligence has been done by all the authorities issuing such documents. If an exporter is not found at his Registered address, then the possibility is that he would have changed his place of business and records may not have been updated. He offered his services to help the Authorities to locate the exporter and helped them in the investigation.



He said that there are many instances where actual payment of GST to government is very low as compared to IGST refund since while few goods are subject low GST, many services used by exporters have high GST. Therefore, if a merchant exporter has taken goods at 5% and services at 18%, he has sufficient ITC at his credit to pay for 5% IGST at the time of exports. He may not either pay IGST in cash or pay only a fraction of that while claiming complete refund of IGST.



Mr Saraf added that such news also makes our international buyers jittery as they consider Status holders much creditable since the scheme is in operation for over 50 years and helped in establishing the reputation of such exporters in India as well as abroad. The Report wrongly paints the status holders, who contribute to over 60% of the country's exports.



FIEO admitted that exporters were critical of the GST Scheme as, in the initial stages, the refund process for GST faced numerous challenges. The GST refund has affected the liquidity of exporters since there is a time lag between the payment of ITC and its refund at the time of exports. Unfortunately, the Scheme of e-wallet, which has been recommended by the GST Council as early as 6th October 2017, which was expected to be put into operation in April 2018 and then deferred to October 2018, has not yet been rolled out. The Scheme may have helped in easing the liquidity problem of exporters. However, he admitted that GST has imparted much needed competitiveness to exports.



President FIEO has written to the Government requesting the authorities to discuss the issue across the table and explore solutions to minimize, if not avoid, the revenue leakage all together.

143,GST fraud: Probe body seeks e-surveillance powers,"GST probe body plans e-surveillance to check fraud (Reuters)

The apex anti-evasion body under GST, Directorate General of GST Investigation (DGGI), has asked the government to allow it to intercept electronic communication dynamically to improve its success rate in apprehending tax evaders. Currently, 10 government agencies, including Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), can intercept, monitor and decrypt information transmitted or stored in any computer after requisite permissions.

DGGI argues that it needs such a power to track slippery traders, who often pretend to run a genuine business but have no real assets on the ground. In the pre-GST regime, the organisation was tasked with gathering intelligence on companies that came under the excise and service tax regime. These firms have physical assets on the ground and evaders among them can’t disappear overnight.

“Earlier, even if the promoter of a manufacturing firm fled after evading taxes, tax officials could recover some value from physical assets. But in case of traders, officials conducting raids end up with empty warehouses along with a small number of insignificant employees. There is no recovery in such cases leading to revenue loss for the government,” an official said on condition of anonymity. He added that DGGI can act in real time and catch such fly-by-night traders if it was given DRI-like powers.

As per the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, during April-February period of FY19, the department detected tax fraud of nearly `20,000 crore. It managed to recover half the amount through enforcement measures, it said.

Another central tax official said officials at the level of assistant commissioners can request for permission to check the digital records of an assessee, including email accounts and phone messages. But past records only confirm tax evasion, they don’t help in real-time when arrests are to be made, he added. Among other changes in GST enforcement strategy, the department is also mulling a more frequent audit cycle instead of conducting it annually, as is the practice.

Officials said the audit forms can be designed to ensure compliance. This is in line with international best practices in taxation and could go a long way in preventing evasion, another official said.

Officials who were part of the deliberation on measures to curb evasion through fake invoices said the indirect tax department was concerned about the possible exploitation of integrated GST refunds availed by exporters through illegal bills. Unlike the earlier regime, exporters pay the relevant IGST on value of exports and then claim the reimbursement as exports do not attract GST.

However, given that exports are controlled by the Customs department, the GST officials said the fully automated online system which approves refunds is being gamed by some exporters. This could be plugged by getting GST officials as part of the vetting process.

Although the fully online and centralised GST system is better at collecting data and detecting evasion than the previous regime, the lack of full-fledged return-filing system has created gaps in the original design of the system. It’s expected that GST Network – which runs the IT backbone for the tax regime – will implement a simplified and comprehensive return-filing and invoice-matching system for more robust detection of fraud.",NA,"GST probe body plans e-surveillance to check fraud (Reuters)The apex anti-evasion body under GST, Directorate General of GST Investigation (DGGI), has asked the government to allow it to intercept electronic communication dynamically to improve its success rate in apprehending tax evaders.

GST: The Union government has booked nearly 1,800 cases for issuing fake GST invoices since 2017-18. The highest number of cases have been booked in the last financial year when the authorities booked 1,220 cases involving an amount of nearly Rs 9,500 crore. The government informed the Rajya Sabha that 1,796 cases for issuing fake GST invoices has been booked in three years to claim the Input Tax Credit (ITC) available under the GST.

In July 2017, a nationwide goods and service tax was implemented to subsume a host of taxes on production and supply of goods and services levied by both the Union and state governments. The new tax on production and supply of goods was meant to eliminate the cascading of taxes by providing input tax credit for taxes already paid in the previous stages of manufacturing. However, some businesses started misusing this provision by issuing fake GST invoices to claim the tax concession.

In the last 9 months of FY 2017-18, the central board of excise and customs (CBIC) booked only 8 cases for issuing fake GST invoices, involving an amount of Rs 14.15 crore.

Fake GST Invoice: Two years after the implementation of a common nationwide goods and services tax law, the Modi government has launched a major enforcement drive against the tax evaders. In an unprecedented operation, a joint team of directorate of revenue intelligence and directorate general of GST intelligence raided more than 300 locations across the country. The operation was so massive that it involved more than thousand tax officers of CBIC. It also involved interception of live export consignments at Vadodara rail container terminal, Mundra port and Nhava Sheva port to detect any misreporting by exporters.

“In the biggest ever joint operation by DGGI and DRI against the exporters who were fradulently claiming refund of IGST, pan-India searches were carried out at 336 different locations across the country,” ministry of finance said in a statement.

The joint operation of the two premier intelligence agencies of the central board of indirect taxes and customs (CBIC) was a first of its kind involving about 1200 officers.

CBIC said analysis of the data revealed that some exporters were exporting goods on payment of IGST entirely on the basis of input tax credit availed on fake supplies and these IGST payments were claimed as refund on export.

How the govt unearthed the GST fraud

In order to detect this huge GST evasion by exporters, tax officers used the data provided by the directorate general of analytics and risk management (DGARM). The exercise involved matching of export data available with the Customs deparment with the corresponding GST data of exporters.

The exercise revealed that there was hardly any payment of tax through cash by exporters and their suppliers.

“In few cases, even the tax paid through ITC was more than the ITC availed by these firms. On the basis of this intelligence, searches were conducted on the premises of exporters and their suppliers,” said the government.

“The day long operation revealed that many of the entities spread across the length and breadth of the country were either non-existent or had given fictitious addresses.”

Amount of GST Fraud

An early investigation conducted by the tax officials revealed that input tax credit of more than Rs 470 crore was availed on the basis of fake or bogus invoices. The invoice value of these transactions were around Rs 3,500 crore. It was used by exporters for fradulently claiming cash refund.

Another IGST refund of Rs 450 crore is also under examination of tax authorities. During the search operations, tax officers have also apprehended live export consignments of these exporters at Vadodara Rail Container Terminal, Mundra Port and Nhava Sheva Port to detect any misreporting of the information.

Central GST Delhi-West Commissionerate has busted a racket involved in the issuance of fake invoices and defrauding the exchequer to the tune of Rs 108 crore, an official release said on Saturday. The fake invoices without actual supply of goods and services were allegedly being issued by Royal Sales India and 27 other dummy companies.

Two persons have been arrested in connection with the case and remanded to 14 days judicial custody by a local court. The release said the accused were found to be operating 28 fake companies to facilitate fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC), thus defrauding the exchequer.

“Prima facie, fraudulent ITC of about Rs 108 crore has been passed on using invoices involving an amount of Rs 900 crore. Final duty is subject to the outcome of the investigation,” it said.

147,GST evasion? Rampant under-reporting of online sales detected,"Officials estimate that tax frauds of as much as Rs 90,000 crore a year could be taking place, of which the GST system is able to detect about only 10-15%.

The goods and services tax (GST) authorities have stumbled upon instances of online sales reported by several firms that sell goods on e-commerce portals like Amazon and Flipkart being much lower than such sales computed from the tax collected at source (TCS) data furnished by the marketplaces. Given that online sales are more traceable due to the organised nature of the marketplaces, evidence of evasion even in this segment confirms fears expressed by many analysts and state finance ministers like West Bengal’s Amit Mitra that GST evasion is much more rampant and large-scale than officially acknowledged and could be one of the principal reasons for the decline in collections apart from the slowdown in consumption.

Under the GST system, sellers on e-commerce platforms, except those supplying services, are required to register on the GST Network, even if their turnover fall below the GST threshold of Rs 40 lakh per annum. Further, the e-commerce portals are required to deduct 1% of the taxable sales that take place on their platforms before making payment to the vendors and deposit the amounts with the government. The sellers can use the TCS as credit at the time of filing returns and paying taxes.

“We have performed a preliminary exercise which has revealed mismatches between sales extrapolated from TCS and self-declared sales in the monthly returns of sellers. In some cases, such mismatches were found to be to the tune of Rs 2-3 crore but the extent of the under-reporting will be clearly known only after the exercise is over,” an official said. He added that since many such sellers also operate offline (where it is more difficult to do such cross-matching), the quantum of evasion by them could be substantial.

GST administration has been struggling to plug tax evasion since its inception. As a proper invoice matching mechanism is still absent, it has had only limited success on this front. Recently, the government not only extended for yet another time the due dates for filing Form GSTR-9 (annual return) and Form GSTR-9C (reconciliation statement), by one and three months, respectively, to December 31 and March 31, but also undermined the utility of these returns by virtually removing crucial anti-evasion features.

As the GSTR-9 and GSTR-9C forms have now been ‘simplified’, taxpayers won’t require to provide the split of input tax credit availed on inputs, input services and capital goods. Also, they won’t need to provide HSN level information of outputs or inputs for 2017-18 and 2018-19.

Officials estimate that tax frauds of as much as Rs 90,000 crore a year could be taking place, of which the GST system is able to detect about only 10-15%. A large part of evasion happens through circular trading and fake invoices for availing input tax credit. Citing instances of frauds detected by authorities recently, Mitra wrote to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman a few weeks ago: “Fake ITC (input tax credit) means tax lost, as this ITC is not backed by transaction in goods or services in reality. Even worse is the fact that some recent reports are suggesting that these chains appear to be ending in export. This means not only that they are not paying taxes, they are actually getting cash refunds against ITC where actual business never took place.”

“While the revenue department may be correct in their findings, we would expect them to take a soft approach on this so that genuine sellers are not burdened with charges of mis-reporting. Further, even marketplaces should be scrutinised as we have evidence of lot of data problems emerging from marketplaces,” a spokesperson of All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA) said.

“E-commerce operators as well as online sellers are independently loading information of taxable supplies made during a given month to GSTN, and any short-reporting by online seller would attract a notice for additional tax payment together with an interest of 18% per annum,” Rajat Mohan, senior partner at AMRG & Associates, said.

Officials said that some of the fraudulent practices under GST would be better tracked with e-invoicing mechanism which is scheduled to be implemented from April 1 for businesses having annual revenue of over Rs 100 crore. Along with the new simplified return, which is also expected to be implemented from April next year, tax officials would have better tools to detect and pre-empt evasion, they added.",other,"Under the GST system, sellers on e-commerce platforms, except those supplying services, are required to register on the GST Network, even if their turnover fall below the GST threshold of Rs 40 lakh per annum.

The Anti-Evasion wing of CGST Delhi South Commissionerate today unearthed yet another case of fake invoicing and GST fraud involving fake invoicing of Rs 1,600 crores and tax evasion of Rs 241 crores, said a statement by the Ministry of Finance. This time, the fraud was related to a provision of inverted duty structure, which is an arrangement where raw materials have a higher duty, while the finished products attract lower duty.

The investigations have also found a well organised racket of creating bogus firms, issuing fake invoices and bogus e-way bills to generate and encash tax credits. The racketeer had created several firms on the basis of unauthorised access to identity documents of various persons.

Earlier this week, the findings disclosed by states and other stakeholders to the Committee of Officers revealed that the central and the state governments together are facing Rs 20,000 crore revenue loss due to refunds claimed by companies on account of flaws in the GST rate structure. And these types of frauds act as a double-edged sword, giving additional scars to the revenue collection.

Meanwhile, GST Council has introduced the ‘E-invoicing’ facility in a phased manner for reporting of business to business (B2B) invoices to GST System, starting from 1 January 2020 on a voluntary basis. Along with the other benefits, this facility is also believed to check tax evasion.

152,GST query: Vendors on e-commerce platforms get notices,"Under the GST system, sellers on e-commerce platforms, except those supplying services, are required to register on the GST Network, even if their turnover fall below the GST threshold of Rs 40 lakh per annum.

Hundreds of online vendors selling goods on e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart have received notices from the GST authorities to explain the differences in sales numbers reported by the e-commerce operators when they collected tax at source (TCS) and the sales reported by the sellers in their monthly return GST-3B. Large-scale evasion is suspected as taxpayers seem to have under-reported sales and paid lower taxes in self-declared returns.

The notices pertain to the October 2018 to September 2019 period. Taxpayers have asked to explain the mismatch within three days of receipt of notices. As FE had reported in December, the taxman had stumbled upon instances of huge discrepancies in taxable value brought out by two different modes of reporting.

“It is good that the system is detecting such fraud as such practices put undue pressure on honest and genuine sellers. We had supported the concept of TCS for online sellers precisely for this reason,” a vendor said, on condition of anonymity.

Under the GST system, sellers on e-commerce platforms, except those supplying services, are required to register on the GST Network, even if their turnover fall below the GST threshold of Rs 40 lakh per annum. Further, the e-commerce portals are required to deduct 1% of the taxable sales that take place on their platforms before making payment to the vendors and deposit the amounts with the government. The sellers can use the TCS as credit at the time of filing returns and paying taxes.

On the verification of data available with the office, it is noticed that there is a mismatch of taxable value that is declared by your TCS operators when compared to the value declared by you in your GSTR-3B returns for the period between October 2018 to September 2019,” said the notice sent to one of the vendors that was reviewed by FE. In this particular notice, the taxman had found under-reporting of sales by Rs 25 lakh while the taxpayer had declared and paid taxes on only Rs 16 lakh of sales in GSTR-3B.

Officials estimate that tax frauds of as much as Rs 90,000 crore a year could be taking place, of which the GST system is able to detect about only 10-15%. A large part of evasion happens through circular trading and fake invoices for availing input tax credit.

E-commerce operators as well as online sellers are independently loading information of taxable supplies made during a given month to GSTN, and any short-reporting by online seller would attract a notice for additional tax payment together with an interest of 18% per annum,” Rajat Mohan, senior partner at AMRG & Associates, said.

153,GST: Why you should check a supplier’s tax payment history; don’t go by the lowest rates offered by him,"New rules restricted the realisation of input tax credit by a buyer.

GST: If you are a GST registered business then the lowest rate offered by your supplier may not be the best option for you if your supplier has a history of not depositing the GST tax to the government on time. Under the GST law, a supplier is required to file GST return in GSTR-1 form before the 11th day of the next month, which will have the details of all outward supplies. This information is used by the buyers who will use that to avail input tax credit (ITC). According to tax experts, a GST registered supplier’s tax payment record is more important than the low rate offered by him as under the new rules any default in the payment of GST by the supplier to the government would result in withholding of the input tax credit benefits to the buyers of that supplier.

“The lowest quote rate quoted by a supplier may not be the best thing for those buyers who want to avail input tax credit under the GST,” said B Mallikarjuna Gupta, chief taxologist of Logo Infosoft, a company that provides accounting and GST solution applications and software.

It is important as the new rules notified in the second week of October mandate that the input tax credit claimed by a buyer in GSTR 3B form will be matched against the invoice details uploaded by the supplier in GSTR 1 form. These supply details reflect in GSTR 2 return.

If a supplier fails to deposit the GST to the government or defaults in filing the GSTR 1 form on time or if there is any other discrepancy then the input tax credit claimed by a buyer will be limited to the amount for which invoice matching is done and 20% of the amount where invoice matching could not be done. Although the buyer will be able to claim the input tax credit for the entire amount if a supplier has deposited the taxes and correctly uploaded the details in his GSTR 1 form for invoice matching.

The settlement of input tax credit (ITC) for GST registered buyers is important as the withheld amount of input tax credit could be up to 10% of their working capital requirement in a month, particularly in the case of small and medium companies that face cash flow problems.

Tax experts recommend that people should check the tax payment history of their suppliers before finalising a purchase and supply contract.

“SMEs and business in the country need to go one step ahead and figure out whether their supplier is complying with the taxes or not. You will have to check whether he is filing GST returns properly or not,” Mallikarjuna Gupta told Financial Express Online.

Taxation experts say that a purchase decision basically entails consideration of three-four things – the price quoted by a supplier, quality of products, after-sale service and terms of payment among other things. They advise verification of the tax payment history of a supplier as one of the important parameters in the decision-making process. This can be done through GSTN portal.

154,ITC-invoices mismatch: Huge sums sought as GST credit denied,"In October, the government inserted a a clause in GST rule saying that a taxpayer filing GSTR-3B (monthly summary return) can claim provisional input tax credit only to the extent of 10% of the eligible credit available in GSTR-2A.

The Goods and services tax (GST) authorities have blocked input tax credits (ITC) claimed by thousands of businesses to the extent these claims are not corroborated by invoices uploaded by their suppliers, multiple tax practitioners and businesses told FE.

While the government had indeed announced that the credit restrictions would be implemented from January 1, for most of the affected businesses, especially for smaller ones, the move could result in a serious cash crunch, as they can now meet the tax liability for the rest of FY20 only through cash.

Though no estimate is available of how much the blocked ITCs would add up to, given that the credits to thousands of firms have been curtailed and the amount in a large number of cases are in crores, credits worth many thousands of crores appear to have been denied.

Among the firms whose unmatched ITC claims have been blocked in their electronic cash ledger are social media giant Facebook. Godrej Housing, Duroflex are too among who have been hit by the policy. An email sent to Facebook remained unanswered.

An analysis by the GST department showed that as much as 39% or Rs. 2.5 lakh crore of ITC claimed by taxpayers in FY18 remained unmatched with the invoices uploaded by their suppliers. Though the gap had come down to 13% (Rs. 1.7 lakh crore) in FY19, it was still very large and unacceptable to the department.

The government’s stated intent behind the move is to curb credit claims based on fake invoices. The move could improve GST collections significantly for the next two months owing to increased cash payment by taxpayers and aid the government’s efforts to bridge the perceived tax revenue shortfall (against the revised estimate in the Budget). However, experts said that gains to the exchequer could gradually taper off as large number of missing invoices will get reconciled at a later stage. All unmatched invoices cannot be attributable to fraudulent practices, tax experts feel.

In October, the government inserted a a clause in GST rule saying that a taxpayer filing GSTR-3B (monthly summary return) can claim provisional input tax credit only to the extent of 10% of the eligible credit available in GSTR-2A. The eligible credit is only against those invoices which show up in a taxpayer’s GSTR-2A, which is possible only if the said assessee’s suppliers file and upload all relevant sale bills in their GSTR-1 (which contains details outward supplies).

If ITC claimed by a taxpayer in GSTR-3B for a given month is, say, Rs 100 and the invoices uploaded by the suppliers are only worth Rs 80, then ITC of Rs 20 does not show up in GSTR-2A in the form of corroborating invoices. So the total credit available to the taxpayer in the case will be Rs 88 (i.e. Rs 80 plus 10% of Rs 80).

Another expert said that the variance between credit claimed in self-declared monthly GSTR-3B and GSTR-2A return could also arise from various issues including non-availability of qualified manpower to match invoices on a monthly basis, technical glitch in tax filings and the MSME filers filing GSTR-1 on a quarterly basis. Late filing of GSTR-1 also leads to mismatch as suppliers’ invoices don’t show up for matching. The compliance rate for GSTR-1 filing has hovered around 65-70% in recent months.

“Tax credit blockage by tax officers without any notice and hearing is spreading tax terrorism at the grass root level, although it is expected to pump up the revenue collections in February and March. However, this would be mitigated in succeeding months,” Rajat Mohan, senior partner at AMRG & Associates said.

Additionally, the GST administration has also started clamping down on taxpayers which have not filed GSTR-3B for long periods of time by asking the assessees’ bank to freeze their account. Tax practitioners said that several such notices have been received by assessees. One such notice seen by FE has raised a payment demand on the bank branch used by Hyderabad-based assessee. It asked the banks to ‘attach all the current/savings A/c./FDR/TDR and lockers’ of the taxpayer who has failed to file GSTR-3B for 20 months and owes Rs 1 crore in taxes.",INFO,"In October, the government inserted a a clause in GST rule saying that a taxpayer filing GSTR-3B (monthly summary return) can claim provisional input tax credit only to the extent of 10% of the eligible credit available in GSTR-2A.

The department has reasons to consider the nefarious elements among the customs broker community may be connected with these frauds, involving fictitious entities, existing only in virtual space through identity thefts with fake and morphed documents, according to sources.

The detection of fraud has resulted in saving the exchequer over Rs 350 crore of refunds, they added.

Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs has obligated customs brokers under their licensing conditions to independently verifying the KYC of exporters, the sources noted.

However, going by the cases detected in recent months, at least 50 customs brokers have been found to have dealt by and large with such exporter entities which are untraceable at their registered addresses and such custom brokers are also under the lens, the sources said.

As investigators probe deeper, newer modus operandi are surfacing, they said, adding that a company by the name of SSR Export was investigated and led to discovering a fraudulent refund claim of Rs 9.88 crore.

As per the investigation, the firm was ostensibly exporting readymade garments to an special economic zone (SEZ).

Now, with newer techniques of data analytics-based risk management being available to officers, the taxpayer was selected for physical scrutiny and found non-existent at his declared address, they noted.

Using a web of fake invoicing of over Rs 847 crore, the firm created a fraudulent credit of Rs 195 crore and investigations led to discovering untraceable suppliers.

The accused, who had a long-term visa, was arrested on Wednesday by the officials of Directorate General of Goods and Services Intelligence (DGGI) in Indore, about 195-kms from here, they said.

The arrest came after the DGGI officers conducted simultaneous search operations at five godowns controlled and operated by the accused as well as his residence in Indore on Saturday and Sunday.

""Unaccounted stock of pan masala / tobacco having total estimated value of about Rs 2.25 crore was seized during the search operation,"" a statement issued by the Additional Director General, DGGI, Bhopal zone, said.

Pan masala/tobacco was found to be stored in the godowns clandestinely for its distribution in various districts of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and other neighbouring states, the statement said.

During the search at the residential premises, Rs 66.47 lakh unaccounted cash amount was also seized, it said.

In his statement given to the officers, the accused confessed that the seized cash was the sale proceeds of the pan masala/tobacco supplied without issuing invoice and without payment of GST, the statement said.

Based on preliminary investigations by the DGGI, it has been estimated that the accused person and his associates have evaded GST of around Rs 18.80 crore on the goods, valued at about Rs 40 crore, sold illicitly for cash during the period from April 2019 to May 2020, it said.

Considering the huge scale of tax evasion, in order to protect revenue, procedure of provisional attachment of immovable properties and bank accounts of the accused was initiated.

""Under this process three immovable properties and five bank accounts belonging to the accused and his associate were provisionally attached on Wednesday,"" the statement said.

The accused was arrested on Wednesday and produced before an Economic Offences Wing (EOW) Court in Indore that has remanded him to 14 days judicial custody up to June 17, it said.

""Investigations by DGGI have also revealed that the arrested person is a Pakistan Passport holder,"" the statement said.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has been informed about his arrest, an official said.

The arrested person, aged 33 years, is a native of Jacobabad city under Sindh province of Pakistan, the official said.

Guthkha sale and consumption is banned across most Indian states. The sale and distribution of pan masala and chewing tobacco had also been completely banned across India due to the pandemic-induced lockdown implemented from March 25, considering its risk in spreading COVID-19 infection.

""This detection and evidence collected by DGGI indicates that some unscrupulous dealers may have, unfortunately, taken undue benefit of this emergent situation,"" the DGGI statement said.

The market information suggests that these banned goods were being sold and consumed in some places within Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra during the lockdown period, at 4-5 times their usual market rates, it said.

""This case has highlighted the risks involving illicit sale and consumption of products like pan masala, tobacco, especially during the pandemic,"" the statement said.

162,Indore: Pakistani national accused of GST evasion of Rs 8 crore sent to judicial remand,"Indore: Four days of joint raids and tireless search operations of DGGI and DRI finally yielded results. Following an estimated evasion of Rs 8 crore in GST, accused Sanjay Mata has been sent to judicial remand till June 17 by a Designated Judicial Magistrate Court on Wednesday. The accused is a Pakistani National and is yet to get Indian citizenship!

Sanjay was arrested by Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), Indore on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he was produced in the Designated Judicial Magistrate (Economic Offence) Court, where the accused filed for bail. The accused's counsel pleaded that the case was totally baseless and the accused hails from a reputed family and would help in court proceedings, thus bail be granted.

Senior advocate and Special Public Prosecutor of DGGI, Chandan Airen, opposed the bail application saying that the nature of crime was very sensitive and the arrest of the co-accused and his brother Sandip hasn't been done yet by the agency. Also, the amount of the GST evasion was too high and the seizure of the cash of Rs 66.47 lakh was a very large amount, thus granting bail would hamper the investigation. He argued that the accused should be sent to JR. Hence, Judicial Magistrate Vijendra Singh Rawat ordered the same.

It may be noted that Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had launched a joint search operation against SS Enterprises at its office and the residence of the its proprietor Sanjay and Sandeep Mata on Saturday. Sanjay was arrested by DGGI on Tuesday. Beside the documents of GST evasion during the search, cash to the tune of Rs 66.47 lakh was also seized. They are accused of selling Paan Masala of various big brands and evaded GST of Rs 8 crore during the lockdown period.

163,GST Input Tax and Refund Frauds a Concern: CBIC,"Fraudulent GST input tax credit claims and fake invoices have become a headache not only for the tax administration but also for taxpayers. GST input and Refund frauds become a concern for CBIC.

CBIC Block Refunds

The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) have blocked GST input tax credit of more than 2000 companies. It has obstructed around Rs 40,000 crores in the name of fake invoices. The data authentication in the department reported a mismatch in filing and returns. Speaking at International Customs Day, CBIC chairman John Joseph, said that the action is in line with directives. Further, the department found cases of GST input credit demand by the buyer when the supplier has not uploaded any invoice. The move will help the government to reduce fake invoice claims.

Small Business Suffer

The decision has disappointed small traders and exporters who have been expecting GST input tax credit. Further, the revenue department linked its income tax return with the indirect tax return and put them under scrutiny. A senior CBIC official accused small traders and exporters of evading tax returns by faking invoices. The department has sent notices for tax discrepancy cases. However, small businesses stated that the officials have not screened documents properly. Further, they complained that though their turnover is large, their profit share remains small and they end up paying huge GST.

Reasons for Failure

Administrative measures play an important role in checking tax evasion. The tax evasion has grown to a large extent since the GST roll out. Further, failure in technology assists evaders to cover the modus operandi. Also, the number of bogus firms is on a rise which claims GST input tax credit fraudulently. Several non-identifiable entities use random PAN numbers to claim GST input credit through fake invoices. Besides, there were some instances where exporters claimed huge cash refunds but paid a negligible amount of tax. In addition, there were several claims under the inverted duty structure where tax paid on GST input is greater than on the final output.

In all, though the government initiated GST to unify the country into a common market, tax evasion continues.",fake invoices,"Fraudulent GST input tax credit claims and fake invoices have become a headache not only for the tax administration but also for taxpayers.

164,The Accidental Prime Minister director Vijay Gutte arrested for Rs 34 crore GST fraud,"bollywood

Updated: Aug 03, 2018 16:06 IST

Filmmaker Vijay Ratnakar Gutte has been arrested for alleged Goods and Services Tax (GST) fraud of over Rs 34 crore, a GST department official said today. Gutte, director of upcoming film The Accidental Prime Minister, was arrested by the Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (DGGSTI) yesterday and produced before a metropolitan magistrate court here which remanded him in judicial custody till August 14, he said.

“Gutte has been booked under section 132 (1)(c) of the CGST Act, which pertains to ‘wrongful availment’ of input tax credit using bills and invoices that have been issued without any supply of goods or services,” the official said.

According to the official, Gutte’s firm, VRG Digital Corp Pvt Ltd, allegedly procured 149 fake invoices involving GST of Rs 34.37 crore for animation and manpower services received from another company, Horizon Outsource Solutions Pvt Ltd.

In May this year, the DGGSTI had arrested the director of Horizon Outsource Solutions for an alleged GST fraud.

The agency’s probe into the case revealed that Gutte’s firm was one of the top clients of Horizon Outsource and was shown as receiving services of about Rs 266 crore with a GST implication of Rs 34.37 crore, even as there was no actual supply of services, the official said.

According to the rules, in cases where the amount of tax evaded or the amount of input tax credit wrongly availed or utilised, or the amount of refund wrongly taken exceeds Rs 5 crore, the accused is liable to be fined and imprisoned for up to five years.

The agency claimed Gutte’s firm wrongfully claimed a cash refund of Rs 28 crore from the government against Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT) credit received for these fake invoices since July 2017.

The agency said Gutte not only availed non-existent input tax credit (ITC), but also fraudulently claimed refund of the ITC from the GST department on the basis of fake invoices.

By doing so, Gutte and his firm defrauded and caused loss to the state exchequer, it said.

Gutte has so far produced three films - Emotional Attyachar, Time Bara Vait and Badmashiyaan.

His directorial debut, The Accidental Prime Minister, is slated to release on December 21. The film, based on a book of the same name about former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, features veteran actor Anupam Kher in the lead role.

165,Excise dept yet to get FIR lodged in ?70-crore fake GST bill scam,"chandigarh

Updated: Oct 23, 2019 01:00 IST

It has been two and a half months since the UT excise and taxation commissioner-cum-deputy commissioner gave directions to lodge an FIR against five bogus dealers in the ?70-crore fake GST bill racket, but the excise and taxation department is yet to get it registered with the police.

Significantly, the department has not even recommended to the police the registration of an FIR in one of the five cases, said a senior UT administration official, who didn’t wish to be named. The directions for the registration of FIR were issued on August 9.

FAKE FIRMS, BOGUS BILLS

The department received information regarding these bogus dealers in January 2019. Thereafter, inspections were conducted of their business premises. During the inspection, it was found that no business was being carried at the locations of these five registered dealers and no stock was present on their alleged business premises.

The five firms were identified as AK Trading Co in Khuda Jassu, Vinita Enterprises in Dhanas, RJ Enterprises in Makhanmajra, Mahadev Metals in Dariya and RD Trading Co in Sector 45. All five were listed as scrap dealers. The five bogus firms issued fake bills without any other company either purchasing or providing any goods or services from/to them. Bills bought by these companies, mostly situated in neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi, were then used to claim input

tax credit (ITC) from the government.

ITC is a tax that a business pays on a purchase and can be used to reduce its tax liability when it makes a sale (by claiming credit to the extent of GST paid).

The dealers generated fake GST bills to the tune of ?70 crore.

The department issued notices for cancellation of the GST numbers of these dealers and directions were issued for registration of a case against them.

Assistant excise and taxation commissioner RK Chaudhary said, “We are following up the matter with the police, and we have been assured that FIR will be registered within a week. We have already submitted the papers.”

DELAY IN IMPOSING PENALTIES

After assessment of the transactions and fake GST bills, notices for unpaid taxes were issued to the tune of ?17 crore and demand was generated. “But the imposition of penalty is still pending except in one case,” said the official.

In the case of AK Trading, the penalty was imposed to the tune of around ?4.3 crore. The dealer has deposited ?47 lakh and filed an appeal with the appellant authority, which is pending.

“We have issued notices for the imposition of penalties on all the defaulting firms. The penalty is equivalent to the tax demand generated,” said Chaudhary.

REGISTRATION OF ANOTHER FIR PENDING

The fake GST bill scam is not the only case where the department has failed to get an FIR registered even after obtaining directions to do so.

On August 8, the collector (excise)-cum-additional excise and taxation commissioner had directed the department to register an FIR against Hotel Turquoise, Industrial Phase 2, for selling liquor without the mandatory liquor licence. But the case is yet to be registered.

166,Four booked for assaulting IRS officers probing GST fraud case in Gurugram,"gurugram

Updated: Aug 16, 2019 10:15 IST

A team of the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence, New Delhi, was allegedly assaulted by at least four persons when the officers were searching a house in Sushant Lok-1 in a GST-related case of fraud, the police said Thursday.

According to the complaint, this group had tried to hinder an IRS probe once earlier on April 12 in Paschim Vihar, Delhi.

On Thursday, an IRS team had come to Gurugram with a search warrant and were conducting a probe when a group of men started abusing the officers and tried to hamper the raid, the police said.

In the police complaint, the complainant, a senior intelligence officer, stated that during their investigation, several persons gathered outside the house’s main gate and started abusing the officers.

“We alerted the police officers following which two policemen came to the spot. To allow the police officers to enter, we opened the gate. This is when four men from the group that was outside forcibly barged into the house. We tried to reason with them that they are obstructing our probe, but one of them pushed a person who was being interrogated,” the IRS officer said.

The complainant added that on April 12, the same group of people had allegedly intervened and tried to obstruct a raid in Paschim Vihar, Delhi.

The police said that a special police officer immediately informed the Sector 29 police station and a team reached the spot.

A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said the accused managed to escape. “The complainant has shared some evidence, including video footage of the incident. We are investigating but no one has been arrested as yet,” said the official.

DGGI’s Gurugram zonal unit arrested Ajit Jindal, the proprietor of the company, as it had fraudulently taken ITC from total invoice value of Rs 28.11 crore on the basis of invoices issued by “fake” firms, the statement issued by the finance ministry on Tuesday stated.

After questioning, he was arrested from the office and was produced before the district and sessions court and taken on remand. On Tuesday, he was sent to 14 days’ judicial custody.”

The probe has revealed that the firms linked with the accused passed on such fraudulently taken ITC to some of the well-established businessmen, who availed of it to discharge their GST liability against the outward supply, with an ulterior motive to defraud the public exchequer.

“Jindal, during the questioning, admitted that his firm had taken ITC fraudulently on the invoices issued by non-existent fake firms and then passed on such ITC to the various spinners, said Chikkara.

168,"Paper, digital trail helps SIT nab CA, clerk involved in ?50 cr GST fraud","gurgaon

Updated: Apr 16, 2018 22:53 IST

A Gurugram-based chartered accountant and an employee of excise and taxation department have been arrested by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Gurugram police for fraudulently trying to claim input tax credit on transactions worth ?50 crore.

The investigation in this case was initiated after a complaint was lodged against a fictitious firm opened by the duo in Sector 40 at the Sadar police station on February 17.

The accused, identified as Rakesh Arora, a chartered accountant, was arrested on April 12 and taken on five days’ remand and he would be produced in court on Tuesday. The co-accused Gourav Behl is an assistant in the excise and taxation department and was responsible for registration and movement of files. He has been sent to judicial custody.

Sandeep Malik, ACP, Gurugram police, who headed the SIT, said that the accused were arrested on the basis of paper and electronic trail which they left while creating the fake firm and carrying out transactions. “The accused had used email addresses, phone numbers and other documents to acquire the GST number and complete other formalities. The team worked on a number of leads and finally apprehended them,” Malik said.

Malik also said that Arora has been involved in another case of financial fraud in which he had submitted a fake no-objection certificate after which a case was registered against him. “The accused wanted to make illegal gains by claiming input tax credit on the basis of fake transactions,” Malik said.

A case against the two accused was registered on February 17 on the complaint of excise and taxation department. The enormity of the fraud can be gauged by the fact that no less than the state finance minister said that the government had assigned a special investigation team to probe the fraud and nab the culprits.

Continuing its crackdown on tax evaders, the commissioner of goods and service tax (GST) in Gurugram arrested three businessmen, including one from Delhi, for fraudulently claiming an input tax credit (ITC) of over Rs 5.7 crore, on Tuesday. This tax credit was earned on Rs 31-crore invoice value; the invoices were issued by a non-existent firm, thus causing a loss to the exchequer.

The officials said further investigation in the matter is in progress and more people involved in the case will be arrested soon.

Sanjay Mangal, commissioner, central GST-Gurugram, said they have arrested Anil Kumar of Hisar, Bhikaram of Delhi and Kuldeep Sharma of Sonepat. The accused had allegedly created a dummy firm—Palak International, registered in Sohna—using fake documents and raised invoices to evade GST. The fake firm issued multiple invoices together valued at Rs 31 crore with a GST component of Rs 5.70 crore, the official; said.

“This company was registered using fake documents of a person identified as Jitender Kumar for the purpose of issuing numerous fake invoices without any concomitant movement of goods for such transactions, thereby providing wrongful availment (of goods) and utilization of fake input tax credit,” Mangal said.

During investigation, the accused confessed to evading tax, officials said.

“The said firm passed on fraudulent input tax credit of Rs 5.7 crore to various buyers who availed the same to discharge their GST liabilities against their outward supply with an ulterior motive to defraud the government exchequer,” Mangal said.

During the investigations conducted so far into the case, the GST and central tax-Gurugram, have recovered an amount of Rs 3 crore towards the tax evaded.

The officials said the businessmen had committed offences under the provisions of Sections 132(1)(b) and (c) of the CGST Act, 2017, which is punishable under sections 132(1), (2) and (3) of the Act ibid and therefore the offence is cognizable and non-bailable under Section 132 (5) of the Act and liable to arrest under Section 69 of the Act.

170,"Rs 8.5K-cr GST fraud detected in 7 states, UTs: Uttarakhand tax dept","dehradun

Updated: Dec 17, 2019 05:43 IST

The Uttarakhand state commercial tax department has unearthed what it suspects to be a financial fraud to the tune of Rs 8,500 crore under Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Uttarakhand and six other states, commercial tax department officials said on Monday.

Sowjanya (who goes by her first name), commissioner of the commercial tax department, Uttarakhand, said apart from Uttarakhand, the fraud involves six other states/Union Territories — Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Delhi.

Sowjanya said the alleged fraud was committed by persons who allegedly raised the value of goods worth R1,200 crores to R8,500 crores through value addition in e-way bills.

The accused, whose identities are yet to be ascertained, are suspected to be part of an inter-state gang involved in this fraud, she said.

E-way bill, or electronic way bill, is generated by GST-registered persons for transport of goods exceeding R50,000 in a vehicle. It is generated through an e-way bill portal.

Sowjanya said the fraud was found during the raids conducted by department officials in at least 70 firms, which were fraudulently registered in the state. “From past few months, the department had been receiving inputs that some of the traders were getting themselves registered in state through fraudulent ways and doing business worth crores of rupees through e-way bills,” she said.

Sowjanya said acting on the tip-off, raids were conducted in the state and 70 firms were found to have generated outward and inward e-way bills worth R8,500 crores.“Digging more, 34 of the 70 firms were found to have generated e-bills citing purchase of machinery from Delhi worth Rs 1,200 crores,” she said.

Out of the 70 firms, 68 showed their registration address in US Nagar district while two in Dehradun districts. After generating e-way bills of purchase worth Rs 1,200 crores, the firms showed transactions among themselves and to traders outside the state, she said.

“They had already applied a claim of GST refund of R6.67 crore. However they couldn’t get the money as our department came to know about the fraud and didn’t entertain the application,” said Sowjanya.

Giving more details about the firms involved in the fraud, Sowjanya said a total of 80 persons used 21 mobile phones, and e-mail ids to get 70 firms registered in Uttarakhand.

“During the initial probe before the raids, the locations of all the 21 mobile phones were found in Delhi or Haryana. To get the firms registered here, they showed address of establishment based in Uttarakhand along with its rent agreement and electricity bills. However during probe the owner of the establishments denied any such rent agreement which further proved that it was a big fraud going on,” she said.

171,"Group busted for supplying fake GST invoices worth Rs 1,000 crore: Finance Ministry","india

Updated: Nov 26, 2019 21:29 IST

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) authority in New Delhi has unearthed a racket involved in tax evasion through fraudulently transporting goods either without invoices or raising fake bills without actual movement of goods, an official statement said.

“The accused was found to be operating 10 fake firms which were created for rotation of money and fraudulent input tax credit (ITC), thus defrauding the exchequer,” the finance ministry said in a statement.

Prima facie fraudulent ITC of about Rs 140 crore has been misappropriated by using invoices involving an amount of Rs 1,040 crore, it said.

“One person has been arrested and remanded in judicial custody for 14 days by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM), New Delhi, at Patiala House Court,” it said.

The modus operandi of the accused was to obtain GST registration of fake firms using documents of unsuspecting individuals and generating good-less invoices and e-way bills of these firms from a place in Tilak Bazar in Delhi, it said.

“On preliminary scrutiny it appears that there is no nexus between inward and outward supplies of the errant firms. Further, the said fake firms have passed on fraudulent ITC to a range of buyers who have availed the same to discharge their GST liability on outward supplies, thus defrauding the exchequer,” it said.

“Investigations are underway to identify the key beneficiaries of this racket and to recover GST involved,” it said.

The accused has committed offences under various provisions of the Central Act 2017, which are cognisable and non-bailable, it said. The accused was arrested on Monday and was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days on Tuesday by the court.",fake firms,"“The accused was found to be operating 10 fake firms which were created for rotation of money and fraudulent input tax credit (ITC), thus defrauding the exchequer,” the finance ministry said in a statement.

172,Rajasthan businessman arrested in Jamshedpur for Rs 10 crore GST fraud,"india

Updated: Jul 25, 2018 19:52 IST

The Directorate of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (DGGI) arrested a Rajasthan-based businessman on Tuesday for evading Rs 10.50 crore in taxes after a nation-wide crackdown against tax evasion unearthed a series of inter-state fraudulent transactions based on fake invoices issued by fake companies to avail input tax credit (ITC) benefits.

“We arrested Dinesh Vyas director of Shrimali Industries Pvt Ltd and proprietor of Vaibhav Enterprises and Shrinali Alloys under provisions of GST Act-2017 and remanded him to judicial custody here on Tuesday. He has been detected as the main person behind the entire conspiracy along with dew unidentified others at this point of time,” Dharamjit Kumar, joint director, DGGI-Jamshedpur, said.

“Their modus operandi was to generate and procure fake invoices without actual receipt or supply of goods or services and thereby facilitating and availing irregular ITC causing huge revenue loss to the government exchequer,” added Dharmajit Kumar.

Earlier on Monday, DGGI Jaipur zonal unit had busted a similar racket of generating fraudulent bills and invoices to claim ITC without depositing the actual GST amount with the government. The gang was also involved in generating GST registration number in names of dead people by using fake addresses.

Vyas came here on Tuesday after being summoned by DGGI following which he was arrested and produced in the special court of Judge YC Verma which sent him to judicial custody. DGGI officials said they would take Vyas on remand soon for further investigation.

Vyas denied the charges and told the media that he has been trapped. “I was not aware that the invoices were fake. I am the actual victim. I will fully cooperate with the investigating agency,” he said.

“Preliminary investigation has revealed that Shrinali Industries (Jodhpur and Gandhidham), Vaibahv Enterprises (Jodhpur) and Shrinali Alloys (Gandhidham) received fake invoices from Sidhi Vinayak Metal and Salt Pvt Ltd (Bokaro) and Ridhi Sidhi Enterprises (Jaipur) without actually receiving any goods or services from them. The said three companies also claimed ITC worth over Rs 10 crore on the basis of such fake invoices from these two companies located in Boakro and Jaipur,” a senior DGGI official said on condition of anonymity.

DGGI additional director general (ADG, Jaipur) Rajendra Kumar had told the media in Jaipur on Monday that a total GST evasion of Rs 58 crore under section 132(1) of the CGST Act, 2017, has been detected so far and three people have been arrested and sent to judicial custody until June 2.

The Jaipur racket was busted after simultaneous search operations at 21 business and residential establishments in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi on May 18.

173,DGGI unearths input tax credit fraud of over Rs 400 crore,"india

Updated: Sep 25, 2019 07:43 IST

The Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (DGGI), Ahmedabad has unearthed input tax credit (ITC) fraud of over ?400 crore by some units at the Kandla Special Economic Zone (SEZ) wherein companies inflated the value of goods by as much as 4,000% to falsely claim ITC.

“The modus operandi detected indicates huge overvaluation to the extent of 3000-4000% of the market value of goods exported to the SEZ and claiming input tax credit refund fraudulently,” additional director general Vivek Prasad said.

Input tax is paid by a business on the purchase of goods and services that go into its own products or services, and claimed as a credit to lower its tax liability when it makes a sale.

DGGI, Ahmedabad Zone conducted searches in three units located at the SEZ and the premises of some exporters in the National Capital Region centred on Delhi after receiving “specific intelligence” that some units located in the Kandla SEZ in Gandhidham, in connivance with 25 NCR-based exporters, had “conspired” to defraud the exchequer, he said. In what seems to be a meticulously planned conspiracy, the products selected by the entities for carrying out the fraud were found to be so-called sin goods such as manufactured tobacco and related products, which are subject to tax at the rate of 93% and 188%, including cess, Prasad said.

“Due to high incidence of taxes on such goods the scope to claim refunds of ITC against refunds is manifold more than the goods which are subject to tax at lower rate of 28% or 18%,” he said.

According to Prasad, the racketeers had sought to derive the maximum illegal gain out of fraudulent transactions. “It is noteworthy to mention that tobacco products are mostly business-to-consumer (B2C) supply items and it is relatively easier to obtain from the market GST paid invoices without corresponding goods, as the goods often get sold in the market without corresponding bills,” he said.

DGGI also found that low-grade products such as “scented jarda, kimam (tobacco extract) and filter khaini” were being manufactured “clandestinely” without payment of tax by some Noida-based units or procured from the local market at the rate of ?150-350 per kg and being exported to the SEZ-based units at the rate of ?5,000-9,000 per kg.

Subsequently, refund of accumulated ITC, sourced fraudulently, in excess of ?500 crore has been claimed by the exporters from the jurisdictional GST authorities, he said. “Due to the proactive steps taken by the DGGI, refund claims of ITC in excess of ?300 crores in the process of getting disbursed by the jurisdictional authorities, have been withheld from going into the hands of scamsters,” Prasad said.

“In addition, the surplus ITC of more than ?100 crore still lying in the credit ledger of such exporters has also been prevented from getting siphoned off by way of likely refunds claims,” he added.

The agency has been able to identify more than 25 such suppliers located in states like Assam, Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh who have issued fake invoices of more than Rs 1,000 crore to the-NCR based exporters without supply of goods to facilitate refunds. These suppliers are either non-existent or are being indirectly controlled by the exporters themselves, Prasad said.

176,"Disproportionate assets: CBI books CGST official, wife from South Mumbai","mumbai

Updated: Jun 27, 2019 08:55 IST

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked a superintendent from the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) office in south Mumbai and his wife in a disproportionate assets (DA) case. Sharadchandra Swaminathan was found to have Rs. 87.52 lakh in addition to his known source of income, said CBI.

CBI’s investigation revealed that from April 1, 2003, to January 8, 2018, Swaminathan and his wife acquired and accumulated assets in the form of immovable properties, cars, bank balances, and other investments worth around Rs. 1.18 crore, against the likely savings of Rs. 30.66 lakh.

“The accused were in possession of disproportionate assets to the tune of Rs. 87.52 lakh, which are in excess of their likely savings,” CBI’s complaint states.

In 2017, Swaminathan had complained to the joint director of CBI about “incessant harassment and demand of Rs. 50 lakh by Mumbai-based CBI officials”. But, in January 2018, CBI arrested him in an alleged bribery case of Rs. 50,000.

On Monday, the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) of CBI registered a suo-motu first information report (FIR) against Swaminathan, a Wadala resident, and his wife under sections 13 (2) and 13 (1) (e) of the Prevention of Corruption (amendment) Act, 2018.

In the complaint, CBI said the agency had received reliable information about Swaminathan acquiring assets disproportionate to his known source of income.

The CBI initiated an inquiry and on the basis of the findings, filed a criminal complaint.

In 2018, CBI had arrested Swaminathan in an alleged bribery case of Rs. 50,000 along with Ashish Thakur, assistant section officer of Central Board of Excise & Customs (CBEC) and Ravindra Kumar Mandal, an examiner at Air Cargo, Mumbai.

CBI had then said that Thakur demanded Rs. 50,000 from Swaminathan to expedite his promotion in the ministry and Swaminathan allegedly agreed and offered to pay the bribe.

CBI caught Swaminathan and Mandal at Antop Hill, while the former was handing Rs. 25,000, an initial amount, to the latter. However, Swaminathan had later refuted all allegations against him. He made counter allegations against CBI officials and said they allegedly extorted around Rs. 8-9 lakh from him between 2014-2016.

177,?110-crore GST fraud at six firms; one held,"mumbai

Updated: Jan 12, 2020 00:39 IST

The officials of an anti-evasion wing of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) unearthed a fraud, in which six companies in the city violated laws to earn undue profits, thereby causing a loss of revenue worth more than ?110 crore to the Government of India. The fraud came to light after Majana Ram, the proprietor of one of the firms was arrested on Friday, for allegedly availing the input tax credit worth ?12.10 crore, by showing fictitious physical inward supply [receipts of purchasing goods] in his GST returns.

The six accused companies allegedly issued bogus invoices of purchase and sale to the government without actually supplying the goods, to pass the fraudulent credit of Input Tax Credit (ITC) to other companies, to avail profits. Input tax credit is an option that allows entrepreneurs to claim rebates for the taxes paid on the purchase of their goods.

“The investigation has revealed that all the accused entities together flouted the laws and claimed ITC worth more than ?110 crore by forming coterie and helping each other in issuing bogus invoices without actually supplying any goods to pass on the benefits of ITC to other companies,” a GST official said.

On Friday, after receiving a tip-off, GST officials initiated inquiries against the private firms. GST officials visited these companies and discovered that most of their registered premises were residential or did not exist at addresses mentioned in their registrations as ‘place of business’. On visiting Ram’s iron and steel trading firm, Omkar Enterprises, at Girgaum, GST officials discovered that the accused was operating from his residential premises. Ram in his statement later admitted that his firm did not have a godown. He also said that he was aware that laws were being flouted and that his firm had not purchased or supplied goods and all the transactions pertaining to purchase and supply were only on paper.

Ram failed to provide any GST-compliant document and told the officials that all his work pertaining to GST was being done by a broker – Kamlesh Bishnoi – and all the sale invoices were also raised by him.

GST officials said that Ram could not give a satisfactory explanation on the undue availing of ITC worth ?12.10 crore by his firm, by showing fictitious receipts in his GST returns. The accused also could not explain how the supplies were made to some firms – Shubham Steelage, Pioneer Overseas, Tirupati Ispat Industries Private Limited, Skyorient Ferromet Private Limited and Paramount Metal Corporation – which are non-existent entities.

GST officials believe that these companies are dummy entities floated to carry out paper transactions without the actual movement of goods.

The probe revealed that Ram played an important role in the racket to pass the ITC rebate to the other firms in a fraudulent manner by issuing bogus invoices without the actual supply of any good and also by availing ?12 crore for his own firm.

Ram has been charged under the relevant sections of Central Goods and Services Act, 2017. A local court remanded him in judicial custody.

178,"Man arrested for ?110-crore GST fraud near Mumbai, search for aide on","mumbai

Updated: Feb 25, 2019 01:01 IST

Officials of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) commissionerate in Raigad, on Friday, arrested a 40-year-old man allegedly involved in issuing fake invoices of more than ?650 crore and availing input tax credit (ITC) of ?110 crore, without the actual supply of goods. According to officials, this is one of the biggest GST frauds detected in recent times.

They are on the lookout for another accused.

ITC allows traders to claim credit for the taxes, which they have already paid on the purchase of goods, from the government. According to the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, issuing an invoice or bill to avail ITC without supplying goods is illegal and can lead to arrest. The case came to light after a month-long investigation by the GST and the Central excise commissionerate in Raigad, under the chief commissioner of Mumbai zone.

According to a senior official of the GST Council in Raigad, Rakesh Hanuman Prasad Garg, 38, in association with his brother-in-law Anand Mangal, 40, issued invoices worth ?650 crore with a liability of ?110 crore, by floating a number of entities dealing in iron, steel and cement.

180,Pharmaceutical firm director arrested for ?158-cr GST fraud,"mumbai

Updated: Jan 09, 2020 00:37 IST

Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) officials on Wednesday arrested the director of a pharmaceutical company for violating GST laws and causing revenue loss to the tune of ?158 crore to the Government of India.

Malad resident Pravinkumar Prajapati, director of Sulabh Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd, has been accused of fraudulently availing ?158 crore as input tax credit on the strength of invoices without receipts of goods or services.

Input tax credit is an option that allows taxpayers to claim credit for taxes paid on purchase.

Based on specific inputs, CGST officials on Tuesday raided four places, including the office of Prajapati’s company, and seized incriminating documents.

Prajapati was booked under relevant sections of the Central Goods and Services Act, 2017. He was produced before a city court and remanded in judicial custody. CGST’s probe revealed that the accused opened 17 firms in his name and those of family members, friends, and employees. Later, only paper transactions were carried out by issuing invoices among these 17 firms without any sale, purchase, or supply of goods or services.

“This was done to inflate the turnover of his companies Dhruv Wellness Limited, Sulabh Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd, and Jayesh Lifesciences Pvt Ltd, and fraudulently avail inadmissible input tax credit,” said an official.

The invoices would be issued among 17 firms in a “circular manner”, the officer said. Prajapati indulged in such fraud practices to also obtain loans from various banks. He used the inflated turnover to convert his company Dhruv Wellness Pvt Ltd into a public limited company and artificially inflate value of its shares, another officer said.",fake firms,"Input tax credit is an option that allows taxpayers to claim credit for taxes paid on purchase.

182,Fake GST refund claims: Tax officials probe bank details of 28 bogus firms,"noida

Updated: Mar 18, 2020 23:57 IST

The economic offence wing (EOW) court in Meerut on Wednesday sent two alleged suspects on 14 days’ judicial custody for their alleged involvement in claiming huge amounts as refunds against the accumulated input tax credit (ITC) on the inverted tax structure in the name of 28 bogus firms. The two men, who are also believed to be the masterminds of the fraud, were arrested by EOW of Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday.

Officials of the central goods service tax department(CGST) said that at least 28 bogus firms had generated invoices for ?1,892 crore that could be claimed as refund. The department had already ordered to make payments worth ?264 crore against the refund claims.

Based on the information gathered during the questioning of the two arrested suspects, the CGST officials have started looking into the bank details of the 28 firms, registered in Gautam Budh Nagar district and other central tax commissionerates such as Greater Noida, Faridabad, Gurugram and Delhi, to ensure safe recovery of the claims disbursed.

Manoj Sinha, spokesperson, Gautam Budh Nagar CGST commissionerate, said after finding that 28 proprietorship and partnership firms had claimed huge amounts as refunds against the accumulated input tax credit (ITC) on the inverted tax structure, two persons were arrested from Meerut during a massive hunt conducted by the department Tuesday. “Both of them have been sent on 14 days’ judicial custody by the state EOW. During questioning, the duo has confessed that they had been assigned by the firms to swindle away the tax returns, showing zero-rated supply of goods in their balance sheets,” he said.

Sinha further said the duo had obtained KYC documents from proprietors and partners of all the 28 firms. “Surprisingly, the account details of all these bogus firms said to be run from 18 different places, were linked to the personal bank accounts of both the arrested persons. We have started checking the bank details of everyone associated with their accounts. I hope we will be able to nab the other players involved in the scam very soon. According to tour finding so far, these bogus firms had generated invoices for passing on the ITC, which is around ?1,892 crore. Due to this fraud, the CGST department has even ordered to make the payments of ?264 crore against their claims. As soon as we smelled the rat, we recovered ?60 crore and withheld the pending claims of ?131 crore,” he said.

Meanwhile, an officer of the EOW team that produced the duo before the court, said that the names of the arrested persons have been kept confidential as their confessional statements indicate that a powerful business syndicate was involved in the alleged fraud. “To us, the arrested duo appears mere pawns as the rackets behind claiming huge CGST refunds in the name of bogus firms have been active in almost every part of the country after the introduction of GST. The amount involved in the fraud can rise multiple time,” the officer, who requested anonymity, said.",fake firms,"Officials of the central goods service tax department(CGST) said that at least 28 bogus firms had generated invoices for ?1,892 crore that could be claimed as refund.

185,Madhya Pradesh HC Grants Bail To Person Accused Of GST Fraud- India Legal,"Want create site? Find Free WordPress Themes and plugins.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court has granted bail to an accused person in case of GST evasion, for alleged fabrication of invoices and upload of the same on the GST portal.

An application for bail was made by the applicant under Section 439 Cr.P.C. for grant of bail during trial which provides special powers to High Court or Court of Session to grant bail. It states that a high court or sessions court can release any person accused of an offence on bail and also impose conditions based on which the order will be granted. The applicantis facing trial for offence punishable under Section 409, 467, 468, 120-B and 427 of the IPC.

The applicant faces an allegation that he had received an amount of Rs.6,52,00,000 for supply of pesticides and insecticides and as against this he had made the supply only for an amount of Rs.4,30,00,000 only and failed to make supply against the payment of Rs.2,22,50,000.

On being approached for supply of pesticides against remaining payment, the applicant continued to avoid the same also misbehaved with the complainant. It has been alleged that he fabricated invoices and uploaded the same on the GST portal.

The Counsel for the applicant prayed for bail being granted to the applicant on the following grounds:

The applicant had himself made a complaint at Police Station in Rajasthan alleging that a sum of Rs.1,35,00,000/- is receivable by the applicant from the complainant but no action was taken.

The allegation that the invoices have been fabricated, is incorrect because the invoices have been shown in the GST Return-1, which tallies with GST R-3

The applicant has at most committed offence under Section 132 of the GST Act, which is a bailable offence

The absence of E-Way Bill is not a conclusive proof of invoices being fabricated or the fact that the supply was not made to the complainant.

The applicant has been in custody since 28.11.2019 and has now been kept in the jail wherein Covid-19 infected persons have been found.

The Counsel for the State opposed the application for bail and stated that the applicant had prepared fabricated and forged invoices without supplying the material and the particulars of the transport, date of supply etc. have not been mentioned in the GST invoices and in some of the invoices date of supply shown is prior to the date of purchase of the goods

The information extracted from the hard disk that was seized from the applicant does not tally with the ledger kept by the applicant and supports the complainant’s version about receipt of money and non-supply of goods by the complainant. The invoices uploaded by the applicant are bogus as they did not contain details of dispatch etc. and there are no E-Way Bills to show that the supply of material as against the payment of Rs.2,22,50,000/- was made by the applicant.

The Counsel also added that the details relating to criminal antecedents of the applicant have not been received from Rajasthan because of the lock down put by the Central and State Government due to Covid-19 infection.

The Court enquired if the applicant will be willing to deposit Rs. 1 Crore with the trial Court and secure the remaining amount by furnishing the solvent security, to which the counsel for the applicant requested that the amount of deposit be reduced by 50%.

The Court considered that the applicant has been in custody since November 2019 and in the present scenario of lockdown the conclusion of trial is likely to take time, ordered the release of the applicant on bail. The applicant has been directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs.1 Lac and deposit Rs.50 Lacs with the trial Court, to be kept by the trial Court in the Fixed Deposit in a nationalised Bank and also furnish solvent security with the trial Court for the remaining amount of Rs.1,72,50,000/-.

188,"Rs 440 crore GST fraud busted in TN, man arrested","Of the three key people involved in the racket, a man was arrested and remanded to judicial custody and two others are yet to be traced. (File image for representation: Reuters)

A racket of issuing fake invoices, without actual supply of goods to the tune of around Rs 440 crore resulting in fraudulent Input Tax Credit utilisation of about Rs 79 crore was busted, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence said in Chennai on Friday.

Of the three key people involved in the racket, a man was arrested and remanded to judicial custody and two others are yet to be traced, the department said.

Principal Additional Director General, Chennai Zonal Unit of DGGSTI, K Anpazhakan, in an official release here said the modus operandi involved securing the PAN and Aadhar of unsuspecting persons on the false pretext of securing a bank loan and using it to float fictitious entities and registering them under the CGST Act, 2017.

The involvement of officials of private banks in the racket by flouting several norms is being probed and further investigation is in progress, he said.

""Searches conducted at several premises revealed that most of them were found locked and admittedly no such activities were carried out there. In fact, one of the declared premises turned out to be a tea shop,"" he said.

Bogus entities were floated in several layers so as to create a complex network of transactions among themselves.

Such transactions include transfer of money in bank accounts to make them appear genuine so that the fake invoices reach the manufacturers who avail fraudulent ITC without receipt of goods and in this case it was metal scrap.

The contact details furnished for registration with the GST department, and related bank accounts were found to be of persons not at all connected in any manner.

The bank accounts were opened by bogus entities using forged documents allegedly in connivance with the officials of private banks, the top official said.

Investigation so far revealed that the conspiracy was hatched by three people, where one had the role of creating fictitious entities and issuing fake invoices without actual supply of goods.

Another played the key role in identifying recipients of fake invoices who actually availed the ineligible fraudulent ITC.

The third person was in charge of the entire day to day activities relating to the racket.

189,Fraud Under Gst,"Fraud Under Gst

Written by KnowYourGST Team under GST

We have the first big fraud under GST. Fraud amount is around Rs. 7 crore.

Fraud is committed by 2 companies from Mumbai. Let's understand what this fraud is all about and how it is done.

First Big fraud under GST

Companies involved in this scam are:

Shah Brothers Ispat Private Limited, director Pravin Mehta VN Industries Limited, director Vinaykumar D Arya

Fraud done by these companies is about availing wrong input credit by exchanging bogus purchase invoices.

This scam is done at large scale in whole country but under GST, it is first time something of this large scale is caught.

Under CGST Act 2017, if you commit a fraud with value more than 5 crore, it becomes a non bailable offense. In this case Shah Brothers has done fraud above Rs. 5 crore and director is not granted bail, director of VN Ispat got bail.

Amount involved in GST fraud

A total amount of Rs. 7 crore is involved in this fraud.

Shah Brothers Ispat Private Limited allegedly availed an ineligible credit of Rs 5.20 crore. VN Industries Ltd availed ineligible input credit of Rs. 2.03 crore.

How the fraud was done?

Both parties purchase goods only on papers and no actual supply of goods was involved. Suppliers have confirmed that they only gave purchase invoices and no supply of goods was made.

This was done to avail wrong input credit of GST and also to avail loan from banks but making bogus Letter of Credit (LOC).

“They were only exchanging invoices for the so-called sale and purchases. The transaction was happening only on paper, and no actual goods were being bought or sold,” said Manpreet Arora, additional commissioner of CGST Mumbai unit.

Here the interesting part is that though government will not suffer any tax loss, because supplier if does not pay tax to government, ITC cannot be availed. However it is still an offense under CGST Act.

This is the first such case we have seen.

However we know in real world this particular transaction takes place in each and every city.

Every day many professionals who play role of brokers, fix these bogus purchase and sells. It is happening in all cities.

You can check 90% tax professionals are involved in this commission agent business. No fraud can take place without tax consultants (Chartered Accountants), prime minister Narendra Modi was not wrong in quoting that no fraud can take place if auditors wish so.

We have seen NAFRA being constituted to regulate professionals such as CA, CS and CMA. This is time that these professionals think on their roles.

This is not to disrespect anybody but we know actual situation.

We know that almost all consultants are involved in helping their clients in trading bogus bills. We have to change our-self to regain lost glory.",fake invoices,"Fraud Under GstWritten by KnowYourGST Team under GSTWe have the first big fraud under GST.

190,Government issues warning against fake GST invoices,"NEW DELHI : The government Monday warned businesses against generating fake invoices to evade GST, saying tax officers will take strict action in such cases.

Speaking on the second anniversary of the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said the menace of fake invoice needs to be checked to ensure that honest taxpayers do not suffer and the government does not lose revenues.

""The government will take strict action against those involved in generating fake invoices. The menace of fake invoices needs to be checked as the actions of few unscrupulous traders make the majority of honest taxpayers uncompetitive and cause loss to government revenue. The government is ""serious about curbing this menace"", he said.

He also urged GST officers to be sensitive to the concerns of honest taxpayers saying their interaction with trader moulds public opinion about GST.

""Therefore, I urge all GST authorities to remember at all times that as public servants, they serve the trade by being sensitive to their concerns and resolving their genuine difficulties in accordance with the law. It is only through this partnership that we can achieve the goal of 'one nation, one market, one tax',"" he added.

Hoping that trade and industry will urge their constituents to shun bad practices and comply with the law, Thakur said the policy of the government would be: ""imandaar trader se bair nahi, fake invoices walon ki khair nahi"" (no honest trader will be troubled but those generating fake invoices will not be spared).

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply in the Lok Sabha on Monday said GST officers have booked 535 cases of fake invoices involving a total fraudulent claim of ?2,565 crore of input tax credit (ITC) and arrested 40 persons so far in the current financial year.

In 2018-19, 1,620 cases of fake invoices were registered involving fraudulent ITC claim of ?11,251 crore under the GST. As many as 154 persons were arrested.

The GST Council, chaired by Union finance minister and comprising state counterparts, last month decided to launch pilot project under which businesses above a specified threshold will have to generate e-invoice for B2B (business-to-business) sales from January 1.

As per the plan of e-invoice being worked out by the tax officers, entities with a turnover of more than ?50 crore will be required to generate electronic invoices on a government portal for B2B sales.

GST, which subsumed 17 local taxes, was rolled out on July 1, 2017. It currently has four slabs -- 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent. On top of the 28 per cent slab, a cess is levied on automobiles, luxury, demerit and sin goods

Penning a Facebook post on the second anniversary of the GST rollout, former finance minister Arun Jaitley Monday said the 12 and 18 per cent tax slabs in the goods and services tax (GST) could be merged going forward as revenues increase, thereby effectively making it a two-tier tax.

Jaitley, who in May wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing his unwillingness to be a Minister in the Modi 2.0 government due to health reasons, said as many as 20 states are already showing more than a 14 per cent increase in their revenues and do not require the Centre to compensate them for revenue loss arising out of GST implementation.

Monthly GST collection data released by the finance ministry showed that revenue mop-up in June 2019 fell to ?99,939 crore, down from over ?1 lakh crore in the previous month. The collection was ?95,610 crore in June 2018.

Thakur exuded confidence that the government will meet the Budget target of GST revenue mop-up.

""Even if there is any shortfall in a particular month's collection, we will achieve the budget target at the end of the fiscal. I can assure you that in the coming months, you will see increase in GST collections,"" Thakur said.

Speaking about improving compliance, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said the information technology system will ensure that the honest taxpayers are completely given a fair treatment.

""But at the same time, if somebody is not complying, the situation will be such that there will be more motivation for compliance. That is the kind of system that is being worked out,"" Pandey said.

Earlier in the day, Sitharaman tweeted, ""Today, we mark the second anniversary of the #GST. We are committed to greater simplification of the process. Thanking the @GST_Council, all state governments, union territories, trade and industries for their continued support.""

194,"Govt plans to use fraud analytics to analyse GST data, check tax evasion","New Delhi: With instances of tax evasion on the rise, authorities are keen to bring in fraud analytics to analyse goods and services tax (GST) data.

The GST Network will soon invite proposals from companies specializing in fraud analytics. These companies will be tasked with mapping specific patterns of taxpayers looking to defraud the exchequer.

The move comes at a time when the government is worried about revenue losses due to tax evasion under the GST regime. Data released by the government showed that tax revenues dipped marginally for the second consecutive month in February.

“We are issuing a request for proposal (RFP) very soon for providers who will study patterns (from GST data collected) and look at whether there is tax evasion. We were thinking of doing it after one year but the government has asked us to advance the process,"" Prakash Kumar, chief executive officer at GST Network (GSTN) said. “Trained investigators will be able to look for both known and unknown patterns of fraud.""

Tax authorities and GSTM have already discovered many innovative ways in which taxpayers are evading taxes.

In one instance, the same e-mail ID was used for multiple registrations across four states in an attempt to evade taxes. There have also been instances where there has been massive underreporting through collusion between buyers and sellers.

Tax authorities are hoping that anti-evasion measures like the e-way bill and invoice matching will curb evasion and improve revenue buoyancy.

195,DGGI cracks down on exporters claiming tax refunds fraudulently,"NEW DELHI : Central government agencies dealing with indirect tax evasion have bust a racket of exporters claiming tax refunds fraudulently, in a nationwide crackdown, the Union finance ministry said on Thursday.

Officials of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) and the Directorate General of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) have tracked down exporters who were fraudulently claiming refund of integrated GST (IGST) after searches at 336 locations across the country on Wednesday, the ministry said.

The probe revealed a fraudulent input tax credit of more than ?470 crore. The money was used to pay IGST on exports and cash refund on this was subsequently claimed, the ministry said.

The invoice value of transactions on which input tax credit was fraudulently claimed was about ?3,500 crore, the ministry added. It also said that a tax refund amount of around ?450 crore is under examination.

“Some live export consignments of these exporters have been intercepted at Vadodara Rail Container Terminal, Mundra port, and Nhava Sheva port for examination to ascertain misdeclaration,"" said the ministry.

The agencies were able to track down the fraud, as GST is a technology-oriented tax system, which makes data gathering and analysis easy.

The operation covered entities in as many as 15 states, including Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Karnataka.

196,"Govt could be losing ? 5 tn in GST revenue over defaults, evasion","New Delhi: he government may be losing ?5 trillion in indirect tax revenue a year, amounting to 40% of its goods and services tax (GST) collection target, because of defaults and evasion, according to the Fifteenth Finance Commission (FFC), confirming policymakers’ fears that businesses are not paying their fair share of taxes.

In a recent presentation made to the GST Council, FFC has assessed that the revenue loss was equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP). This works out to ?5 trillion if one goes by the first advance estimate of nominal GDP for FY20 released earlier this month. This is as much as 40% of the GST revenue Centre and states together may collect this year, going by the trend of an average ?1 trillion a month GST revenue in the first nine months of this fiscal.

In the nine months to 31 December, central and state governments have collected more than ?9 trillion in GST and hope to collect another ?3.55 trillion by March-end.

FFC’s estimate of revenue loss from non-compliance is giving a strong backing to the tax administration’s bid to tighten enforcement at a time it is struggling to meet the revenue targets for the year. According to FFC, India’s overall tax-to-GDP ratio is about 17.2%, which, as per its calculations, should be about 22.6%. There is a gap of about 5.4%, of which GST compliance gap accounts for about 2.4% of GDP, according to the FFC presentation, the highlights of which are now available in public domain from the minutes of the meeting.

A team of economists from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday gave a presentation to FFC on resource mobilization over the next five years, with special focus on improving the revenue realization from GST. The IMF team presented that the current collections were significantly below an estimated revenue frontier for the country. “It was further discussed that rationalization of the rate structure as well as improvements in compliance and collection efficiency of GST and other taxes can move India much closer to the frontier,"" a statement by FFC said.

What has led to the GST revenue gap is the slowdown in consumption, raising the threshold for GST registration to ?40 lakh in sales from the original ?20 lakh, a series of tax rate cuts, raising the threshold for small businesses to register for a concessional tax scheme from ?1 crore to ?1.5 crore and instances of tax evasion. Besides, there have been several extensions of the deadline for filing annual return for the first year of GST—FY18—the latest being 31 January 2020. “Invoice matching is supposed to be the soul of GST, which has not happened the way originally envisaged. This feature of GST would have ensured better compliance,"" a government official said on condition of anonymity.

According to Indira Rajaraman, economist and former member of the Thirteenth Finance Commission, both the GST revenue slump and the economic slowdown could be traced back to the hardships that small businesses have suffered in the GST regime.

“The vibrancy of the Indian economy and its job creation potential depended on small, informal businesses to a large extent,"" Rajaraman said. “The snapping of the relation between these small businesses and their larger counterparts on account of various factors including their fear of coming into the formal system and having to deal with tax authorities have contributed to both the economic slowdown and the slump in GST revenue receipts.""

The government has taken a series of steps towards revenue augmentation, which includes cancellation of registration, blocking of e-way bill and restriction on use of tax credit in certain circumstances.

In recent months, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs has started a crackdown against misuse of tax credits and GST evasion. The drive against GST fraud comes at a time central and state governments are facing a revenue shortfall amid an economic slowdown at its worst in 11 years.

GST authorities have now zeroed in on about 40,000 companies for claiming excess or wrongful tax rebates, which will now be pursued for recovery of tax dues. A ministerial panel led by Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac is exploring ways to curb evasion of GST on gold. The measures would include mandating electronic permits for transportation of the metal.

197,"Govt detects Rs. 20,000 crore GST evasion in April-Feb FY 2019","New Delhi: The government has detected Rs. 20,000 crore worth Goods and Services Tax (GST) evasion so far this fiscal and will take more steps to check frauds and increase compliance, a senior tax officer said on Wednesday.

Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs Member (Investigation) John Joseph further said the department would soon call a meeting of the representatives of the real estate sector to understand transition issues faced by the sector post reduction in GST rates.

The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising state counterparts, earlier this week decided to cut tax rates on under-construction apartments and affordable housing to 5% and 1%, respectively.

However, builders will not be able to claim credit for the taxes paid on inputs, like steel, cement.

The earlier GST rate on under-construction apartments and affordable housing was 12% and 8% with input tax credit (ITC), respectively.

On demand for giving ITC relief to the builders of the under-construction flats which are already built but not yet sold to buyers, Joseph said the real estate sector will have to raise the issue with the urban development ministry.

""You need to talk to them (urban development ministry). As revenue department we cannot give you any benefit of subsidy to that extent,"" he said at an Assocham event here.

Joseph said between April-February 2018-19, GST evasion worth Rs20,000 crore has been detected of which Rs10,000 crore was recovered.

He said the tax officers on Tuesday detected fake invoice worth Rs. 1,500 crore which was used to claim illegal GST credit of Rs. 75 crore.

""We have already recovered Rs. 25 crore and the rest is on the way,"" Joseph said.

Stating that only 5-10% of the businesses are ""black sheep"" and bring bad name to the industry, he said the government will take more measures to increase compliance, and act against evaders in a way such that genuine businesses do not suffer.

Joseph said the government has been dynamic in rationalising tax rates since GST rollout on 1 July 2017, while increasing compliance for 1.2 crore registered businesses.

""In future, as GST moves forward, the rates need to consolidate. Across the world it is one rate, but it may not be possible for us to implement it here... because we have the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich in the country.

""What is good for the richest, cannot be the best for the poor... But five rates converging into two or three, depending on what the Council decides. This is the way forward,"" he said.

Currently, GST has 4-tier slab of 5, 12, 18 and 28%, while essential items are zero rated.

Currently, state tax officials administer and control 90 per cent of the assessees below ?1.5 crore annual turnover, and the remaining 10 per cent is with the central tax officers.

For those assessees with an annual turnover of over ?1.5 crore, the Centre and states share control in 50:50 ratio.

To plug leakage, the central and state government officials had last month decided to scrutinise goods and services tax (GST) refund claims more diligently, compulsorily investigate all fake claims and step up coordination between income-tax and GST authorities.

It was also decided that GST Network, CBIC and Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) will share data on a quarterly basis for early identification and checking of fraud cases.

Following delay in payment of GST compensation to states by the Centre due to lower-than-expected revenue collection the authorities have decided to step up enforcement actions and data exchange.

199,"GST watchdog detects invoice fraud to the tune of ? 7,600 crore","NEW DELHI : The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGSTI), an arm of the indirect tax administration, has unearthed a racket involving 90 firms which issue fake invoices to errant companies for tax evasion, the agency said on Friday.

DGGSTI said a resident of Sirsa in Haryana, who was running the racket, has been arrested and produced before a local court. He was sent to 14 days judicial custody.

The agency has found that the accused had set up 90 fake firms to issue bogus invoices, without actually supplying goods. Issuing bogus invoices has been a practice among tax evaders and money launderers for a long time.

This was flagged by a special investigation team on black money, led by former Supreme Court judge M.B. Shah, in 2015.

The companies involved in the scam exist only on paper and offer what is referred to as “accommodation entries"", or bogus transactions without commercial substance. These are used by other firms to either wrongly claim input tax credit, or to inflate costs to evade income tax.

DGGSTI said it has unearthed 110 debit or credit cards of individuals and blank cheque books linked to 173 bank accounts from the Delhi residence of the accused.

Fake invoices of over ?7,600 crore with a GST component of ?600 crore have been detected in the current case.The indirect tax administration is now using technology and data analysis to identify tax evaders and is closely working with the income tax department for leads.

201,Five Indians charged on GST fraud claims in Singapore,"Singapore: Five Indians have been charged with making fraudulent Goods and Services Tax (GST) refund claims totalling about $118,300. Each of them faced more than 200 counts of abatement by conspiracy to make false statements in claims made under the GST Act to obtain refunds of GST, The Straits Times reported on Friday.

The five of them have been identified as Kothandaraman Gnanam, 29; Karunanidhi Rajesh, 32; Karunanithi Saravanan, 36; Ramaiyan Karthikeyan, 43; and Waithiyalingam Karunanidhi, 63. The men faced 1,197 charges in all.

They allegedly tried to abuse the electronic tourist refund scheme (eTRS) by making claims for jewellery they did not personally purchase. Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) investigators nabbed them on Wednesday.

These arrests followed a joint operation by Iras and Singapore Customs on 27 May last year, in which the men were caught red-handed for allegedly making fraudulent GST refund claims totalling about $118,300 (S$167,253) at Changi Airport.

The Indian nationals were each offered bail of S$50,000 on Thursday and will be back in court on 24 February. A joint press release by Iras and Singapore Customs stated that tourists can claim GST refunds on goods they have bought and taken out of Singapore.

Those who do not purchase anything but seek or obtain a GST refund under the tourist refund scheme commits an offence under the GST Act. Under the eTRS, a tourist receives a receipt for goods purchased and an eTRS ticket when he buys items from a GST-registered retailer that participates in the scheme.

The tourist can then use the eTRS ticket to make a GST refund claim at ports of departure such as Changi Airport. They can also make similar transactions using the credit cards which they had used to buy their goods.

In a GST refund-claim fraud scenario, an offender will pretend to be a tourist and pay local customers, who are not entitled to eTRS refunds, for their jewellery invoices. With these invoices and by using a passport, the offender will obtain eTRS tickets from the respective shops.

He will then claim eTRS GST cash refunds at ports of departure. Anyone who commits the offence of wilful intent to make a false GST refund claim, or assist any other person to make such a false claim, faces a penalty of up to three times the amount of refund wrongfully claimed and a fine not exceeding S$10,000, and/or imprisonment of up to seven years.

202,"GST compliance regime not yet simple, says CAG","The government has failed to put in place a simplified tax compliance regime and non-intrusive e-tax system remains elusive even after two years of the Goods and Services Tax's (GST) roll-out, according to official auditor, Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

""The complexity of return mechanism and the technical glitches resulted in roll back of invoice-matching, rendering the system prone to ITC frauds. Thus, on the whole, the envisaged GST tax compliance system is non-functional,"" the CAG has said a report tabled in Parliament on Tuesday.

The new indirect tax regime had kicked in July 2017. The transformation tax structure is aimed at reducing tax cascading, ushering in a common market for goods and services and bringing in a simplified, self-regulating and non-intrusive tax compliance regime.

The CAG said that one significant area where the full potential of GST roll out has not been achieved is the roll out of the simplified tax compliance regime.

While it was expected, the auditor said, that compliance would improve as the system would stabilise, all returns being filed showed a declining trend of filing from April 2018 to December 2018.

According to the report, the filing percentage of GSTR-1 returns (monthly returns on outward supplies) were throughout less in comparison to the corresponding filing of GSTR-3B returns (summary self-assessed return). The introduction of GSTR-3B resulted in filing of returns with ITC claims which could not be verified and it appears to have disincentivised filing of even GSTR-1.

""Since filing of GSTR-1 is mandatory, short-filing is an area of concern and needs to be addressed,"" the CAG noted.

GSTR-3B being only a summary return, short-filing of GSTR-1 implied that the tax departments did not have complete invoice level details as filed by the suppliers, which could be used to verify details given in GSTR-3B or to arrive at turnover.

During the audit, the CAG found that system validations were not aligned to the provisions of the GST Act and as a result, there were some crucial gaps in the registration module. Among various gaps, the system failed to validate and debar ineligible taxpayers from availing Composition Levy Scheme.

203,How a Rs 40-crore GST fraud unfolded at Manpasand Beverages,"Vadodara-based Manpasand Beverages Ltd (MBL) was already the centre of a controversy after Deloitte resigned as its auditor in May 2018. Things went even further south earlier this month when its top brass was arrested for the recent goods and services tax (GST) fraud of Rs 40 crore.

The company was set up in 1998 by Dhirendra Singh, its current chairman and managing director. In the following years, the company focused on rural markets and tier-2 and tier-3 cities to grow its presence, as opposed to its rivals who made metros their target.

In 2018, the company's distribution was at its peak with 6 lakh outlets across India, as well as three plants in Vadodara, Varanasi and Sri City. The beverage company had plans to set up its fourth plant. But, the recent unearthing of the tax scam by the Central GST Commissionerate Vadodara showed that the company had used this network to operate through fake units.

Sources told Business Standard that MBL had allegedly created sales and purchases of its products across over 30 fake units.

""Usually the cases one comes across show companies running real units, but acquiring fake invoices here and there to claim input tax credit (ITC). But in case of MBL, it has been found that the company set up several fake units and across the country at that. Real purchase and sale transactions were then shown with values inflating with each transaction in order to claim a cumulatively large sum of input tax credit,"" a source said.

The company allegedly showed inter-unit transactions worth over Rs 300 crore wherein ITC would come up to Rs 40 crore. Government sources said that these transactions were found to have taken place in 2018-19.

Legal experts who are tracking this case said this circular trading happened when one of its real units transacted with a fake unit. More such transactions can be tracked in the company, where the value of the transaction was increased each time. And, eventually, it culminated as a purchase transaction by a real unit.

""The real unit which shows purchase in the end can now claim tax credit on the inflated value at each stage. Mostly, it is even difficult for auditors to find out such a long trail of 30 fake units because there are no RoC (Registrar of Companies) records. Also, there is no law in the country that prohibits such kinds of circular trading. Only CGST intelligence can smell it when they follow the trail on their system and find that these are similar or even same transactions shown again and again,"" an anonymous independent corporate law expert told the paper.

Most of the senior management of the company have resigned, but they have maintained that they did not have any information about these transactions. Vishal Sood, Bharat Vyas, Chirag Doshi, Milind Babar and Dhruv Agarwal, five of the six directors of the company, have resigned.

These are unprecedented times as an extremely severe health and economic crisis is impacting our lives to a major extent, courtesy the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Many distinctive features make COVID-19 a very eclectic crisis. First, it is a highly chaotic and unusual fusion of a deadly disease with an economic calamity. Second, its escalating growth has seen it become a global phenomenon in a very, very short period. Third, as economists would call it, it is an unparalleled supply and demand side (macro-economic) shock with great uncertainty in magnitude and duration. Fourth, its impact is many-sided and includes infection, death and loss of loved ones, severe human suffering in several forms (such as job losses, lack of food and nutrition, loss of education, even if it may be temporary, lack of cash flow for sustenance and livelihoods), greater indebtedness, severe global recession caused by a prolonged (uncertain) contraction in economic activities, brutal individual and corporate (financial) distress, huge stress on the financial systems (thereby exacerbating the supply of credit to the real economy), stoppage of flow of capital due to risk aversion by investors and other stakeholders and so on. Clearly, COVID-19, is a once-in-a-lifetime situation, whose multi-faceted impact will render the world into pre- and post-COVID-19 era’s.

But there is a silver lining to it: countries that are best prepared to assimilate digitisation are likely to recover quickly (in an economic sense) and India appears to be one of them. In a brilliant recent article titled, “ Life in the era of COVID-19 ”, prime minister Narendra Modi has talked of how the COVID-19 situation can be used as an opportunity to change things for the benefit of the poor and humankind and one theme that he repeatedly emphasises here is the need for and use of increased digitisation. As he so very succinctly argues, one thing becomes clear—COVID-19 has given us a rare opportunity to revolutionise our way of life, especially using digitisation and for the larger benefit of all humankind.

One direct result of this could be an even greater use of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) payments system than in the previous years and this precisely provides us with a wonderful opportunity to bring the kind of reform suggested by the PM. Indeed, the present situation provides us with a unique opportunity to reverse what has been happening for the last 72 years and bring in major progressive reforms in taxation.

Direct and indirect tax proposals have that kind of power over an economy, the power to make or break it. And this is the time to rationalise income and other direct and indirect taxes to usher in a total revolution, whereby it will be easier for the government to maximise revenue while simultaneously reducing the burden on citizens. I think that is a pareto optimal goal.

Let me quote from the great Indian epic Mahabharata, which offers advice on taxation to the ruler of the day:

“The king should take wealth from his subjects at the proper time... Like an intelligent man milking his cow every day, the king should milk his kingdom every day. As the bee collects honey from flowers gradually, without causing harm to the tree; the king should draw wealth gradually from his kingdom for storing it.” — Bhishma’s counsel to Yudhishthira. (Mahabharata, Book 12: Santi Parva: Rajadharmanusasana Parva)

So, let us move on to the question of how to rationalize the direct and indirect tax regime and enhance revenue generation for the government while at the same time making it less burdensome for the citizens? We also need to simultaneously ask how India’s tax system be rationalized to eliminate black money generation?

An answer lies in moving away from the existing complex income-tax system to one that is simple, cost effective and transparent, with lower transaction costs and greater ease of operation for the government and the taxpayer.

In the long term, taxation laws need to be simplified. Wherever and whenever possible, positive reinforcement rather than the threat of punitive action must be used to influence attitudes and bring about long lasting behavioural changes.

A transparent and simple tax system can go a long way in helping people negotiate their way through it.

Taxation should be pareto optimal—it should neither diminish the drive for enterprise nor should it result in huge inequities due to the hoarding of money by a select few. An unduly high tax rate and low exemption limits are constraining factors on consumption and enterprise. That is why having a transparent and forward looking tax system is critical for any economy.

What are the criteria that enable a system to be a forward looking transparent tax system?

• Simplicity.

• Transaction Cost.

• Ease Of Implementation.

• Openness.

• Equitability.

Arthakranti , which has reportedly claimed credit for proposing the idea of demonetisation, has proposed a complete abolition of all direct and indirect taxes levied by the Union government, the various state governments and all local bodies across the country, with the exception of customs and import duties that function as international trade balancers. Instead, they propose a banking transactions tax (BTT) at the rate of 2% on all banking transactions, with the exception of cash withdrawals. In fact, the Nagpur-based economic think-tankwhich has reportedly claimed credit for proposing the idea of demonetisation, has proposed a complete abolition of all direct and indirect taxes levied by the Union government, the various state governments and all local bodies across the country, with the exception of customs and import duties that function as international trade balancers. Instead, they propose a banking transactions tax (BTT) at the rate of 2% on all banking transactions, with the exception of cash withdrawals.

Given that BTT would be a flat, single-point tax to be levied by commercial banks on all bank transactions, it would be simple to implement and have practically zero compliance cost. With the numbers of those within the fold of the banking system expected to increase even more significantly (given the drive for 100% sustained financial inclusion), BTT is likely to generate the required tax revenue and have buoyancy too.

The negative fallout might be an attempt at bypassing the banking system, but certain additional measures (discussed in in detail in my above cited book) need to be undertaken to ensure that people prefer not to transact in cash, wherever and whenever possible. However, there exists the challenge of ensuring that the people newly entering the banking system remain within its fold. Simplifying banking procedures and improving the quality of and access to other support services should help achieve that.

Coming back to the BTT, let us look at transaction numbers to understand how beneficial the BTT could be if and when it is implemented. For example, for the FY18-19 alone, the total value of RBI payment system transactions (Table IX.1: Payment System Indicators – Annual Turnover) stood at Rs28,86,465 billion, or Rs28,86,46,500 crore. If we compute a BTT of Re1 per Rs100 (or 1%) across this 28,86,46,500 crore that flowed through the RBI payment system in FY18-19, we get a BTT collection of Rs28,86,465 crore.

Thus, if one were to try to make a projection based on the total BTT estimated to have been collected using the RBI payment system data for FY18-19, the annual total yield from BTT would have been able to easily compensate for the loss of revenue from all direct and indirect taxes which stood at Rs20,80,000 crore as per the data available and cited in “Union Budget 2019-20: An Assessment, RBI Bulletin September 2019” as under column 4, Table 2

In fact, there would have even been surplus revenue of Rs806,465 crore, which is huge by any standards. And more importantly, it would have been far easier and less costly to implement and ensure compliance.

The same principle should hold good for 2019-2020 and I have taken a look at the provisional RBI payment system numbers for 2019-2020 (which is available until February, 2020) and it suggests that a BTT of Re1 per Rs100 transacted through the RBI payment system, should be more than good enough to take care of the total of direct and indirect taxes—budget estimates put it at Rs24,61,000 crore (see column 5, Table 2).

Using the provisional RBI payment system data until February 2020 and also extrapolating it for March 2020, the total estimated revenue from a BTT of 1% would have yielded Rs25,00,901 crore, which as you see is higher than the Budget estimates of direct and indirect taxes of Rs24,61,000 crore (see column 5, Table 2 ). And going forward, post COVID-19, with increased digitization and further stabilization of the economy, the transactions through the RBI payment system should only further increase.

Accordingly, the following changes to the present tax system are suggested.

A crucial first step here is to abolish all direct and indirect taxes—i.e. personal income tax and corporate tax including all kinds of capital gains tax (both short and long term). Corporate tax will also have to be abolished for all body corporates.

GST must also be completely eliminated. The same has to be immediately and seamlessly simultaneously substituted with a banking transaction tax (BTT of 1%) of Re1 per Rs100 transacted through RBI’s payment system.

As the velocity of the payment system and banking transactions increase, the BTT would also be good enough to provide a huge surplus as well. I believe, that, post COVID-19, after the economy stabilises, BTT should ultimately settle down at 75 paise per Rs100 (or 0.75%).

After a few years, with inclusive and further digitization, it could even come down to 50 paise per Rs100 (0.50%) The BTT is what I see as a fair system to taxation, without burdening the common person—it will bring into its fold, almost everyone in the country from a tax perspective (currently, less than 10% of India is part of the direct tax system) and give huge tax revenues to the government and most importantly, without inconvenience to the common man. A forthcoming article dwells on the specific steps and actions that would need to be undertaken to operationalise this idea in real time.

The country has been through testing times. Even in the face of adversity, the people have stoically borne inconveniences/losses in the hope of a liberalised economy in the future that will yield benefit to all. Taken together, the abolition of direct and indirect taxes and their substitution with a BTT, as outlined above, should start to yield significant results.

Once the above is done, it is expected that the various pillars of economic growth will automatically start to move and move at an increased pace. Over time, the shift to a BTT should greatly enhance domestic consumption, increase domestic savings, further reduce interest rates for lending and make exports competitive, apart from helping to generate surplus funds for development (including infrastructure), enhance investment, eliminate poverty and transform India into a rapidly growing, stable and inclusive economy.

Together, the abolition of direct taxes and indirect taxes and introduction of a simple BTT should also help in building a more competitive industrial base in India, especially among the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and also in manufacturing in general. Various manufacturing clusters that are doing badly should now be able to do better and without a doubt, exports will pick up.

The move to BTT (with additional reforms in the real estate and other sectors) should also enhance the overall size of the economy, especially given that the informal sector and the parallel (black) economy in the real estate sector would have been fully absorbed into the mainstream.

One last point is in order. Much has been tried for the past 72 years (with varying degrees of success) with regard to building a vibrant economy and I strongly believe that it is a now or never situation for the Indian economy today.

What we do now will determine the quality of life for our children and grand-children (much into the future) and India is clearly at the cross-roads.

Here is a great opportunity to create a vibrant and dynamic economy and that should be utilised. That is what India needs today and that is what will cure our ailing age old system of economic governance and push us into an era of dynamic and vibrant entrepreneurship based on sound fundamentals into a period of long-lasting (hopefully, double digit) growth.",NA,"We also need to simultaneously ask how India’s tax system be rationalized to eliminate black money generation?

205,Builder jailed for $3.4m GST fraud,"GST fraud worth $3.4 million has seen a new homebuilder sent to jail, in what the ATO described as an example of “classic illegal phoenix behaviour”.

Sydney man Benjamin Ensor, 56, was convicted of lodging false business activity statements (BAS) on behalf of nine separate companies of which he was the sole director, and also withheld declaring property sales in a bid to avoid paying GST.

That had the effect of denying the ATO some $3.4 million in tax revenue.

In a statement, the tax office said Mr Ensor had deliberately set up the companies to manipulate their GST liabilities, and then used the funds raised to help pay for the development of five luxury beachfront apartments in Manly, on Sydney’s northern beaches, as well as purchasing luxury items including his home, a catamaran and a marina at Lake Macquarie.

It said that Mr Ensor reported total expenditure of more than $24 million and claimed over $2.2 million in GST refunds, by falsifying invoices to show related companies had provided project management services and creating fake invoices for the purchase of machines and vehicles.

Meanwhile, the failure to report sales of the Manly apartments amounted to a further $1.5 million being withheld.

According to the ATO, Mr Ensor will spend six years behind bars, in addition to being ordered to make reparations to the tune of over $1.8 million.

“Illegal phoenix activity is a serious threat to the integrity of the tax and superannuation systems and costs the community billions of dollars every year,” ATO assistant commissioner Aislinn Walwyn said in response to the judgment.

“This case exhibits classic illegal phoenix behaviour. Companies were deliberately liquidated to avoid paying creditors and taxes. New companies continued operating the same or a similar business with the same ownership.”

She added: “Today’s result demonstrates the ATO’s commitment to detecting and prosecuting the most egregious tax crimes and should serve as a warning to those who think they can flout the law and get away with it.”

One My Business reader recently suggested that a means of reducing phoenix activity, that leaves creditors — including other businesses — out of pocket, would be the establishment of a national register of supply agreements for all business-to-business contracts.

211,GST fraud: Rs 52 cr tax evasion traced,"By Express News Service

BHUBANESWAR : The State GST enforcement squad on Thursday busted a racket involved in tax fraud of Rs 52.77 crore by generating fake invoices of Rs 294 crore. Proprietor of Sahoo Traders Pramod Kumar Sahoo of Sailashree Vihar and Vikash Sarawgi of Patia here were arrested in this connection. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes and GST Sushil Kumar Lohani said after tracking a chain of fraudulent transactions followed by scrutiny of suspected waybills of 11 business establishments, which were not existent, the squad arrested the two involved in the fraud.

“With the help of locals, Sahoo and Sarawgi collected document from some innocent people of Kandhamal district by assuring to facilitate them benefits from different Government schemes and opened the fictitious firms,” Lohani said. The accused misutilised the document for GST registration and opening of current accounts in different banks. They also forged house rent agreements submitted as proof of their firms.

Additional Commissioner (Enforcement) Manabhanjan Acharya said the rent agreements signed in 2018 contained forged signature of the house owners, who had already died in 2006 and 2012. “The bank accounts were opened and operated by forging the signature of account holders. The accused fraudulently passed on input tax credit of Rs 52.77 crore in the names of fictitious firms created and operated by them through fake invoices,” Acharya said.

It was also found that Sahoo and Sarawgi had purchased iron rod and scrap without payment of tax and obtaining purchase invoices from the actual supplier.

Earlier, seven persons were arrested in three cases for allegedly committing fraud of Rs 273 crore.

212,GST sleuths smell ‘political funding’ in fake invoice frauds,"Rahul V Pisharody By

Express News Service

HYDERABAD: GST Intelligence sleuths pursuing a trail of tax evasion through fake invoices recently ended up knocking on the doors of a couple of India’s top infrastructure companies, which seemed to be the end beneficiaries of the fraud. However, they found that this fraud was only a part of a scheme to convert white money to black to facilitate political funding.

It is hardly a surprise for investigators that the fake invoices were generated to show expenditure towards non-existent supplies. This was done only to create an outward trail of money from the balance sheet.

Over the last month, as many as 32 premises belonging to 27 persons were raided by the investigators. Some of these companies are fictitious and non-existent. However, input credit has been passed on to seven to eight other companies, who have in turn passed it on to three to four mega infrastructure companies. According to sources, the total value of invoices generated is Rs 1,668 crore, and the total evasion of tax amount to Rs 174 crore to begin with. Three persons have been arrested so far in order to prevent tampering of evidence, and Rs 20 crore tax has been realised. The big companies, meanwhile, agreed to pay back, said sources.

A demand notice asking why action should not be taken against them has been issued, and upon admission, they have agreed to pay up the evaded tax along with 100 per cent penalty and interest as per norms. As on date, these big firms have decided to “buy peace from being arrested” and agreed to pay up Rs 23 crore as further investigation is on. “That’s not the end of it. They are liable for prosecution,” said sources.

“We have enough indications to say that the money is used for political funding. The fake invoicing has become a compulsion for big companies to show the routing of cash outwards from the company,” said an official in the know of things.

The role of the big players was unearthed after the nabbing of fake suppliers or persons operating fake entities. “The big companies have registration in each State and suppliers all over India. It is very difficult to detect such a fraud as it involves circular trading. In this case, we detected a few fake suppliers and then investigated upwards,” said the official. For instance, in order to legally remove Rs 100 crore from the balance sheet, a company may show delivery of some non-existent services or goods for which it is billed. The input tax credit from fake bills is, however, used to lower its tax liability. “That’s just a bonus for the company. Our role is limited to detecting GST frauds. The money laundering aspects will be investigated by multiple agencies with whom we share information,” he said.

Fudging of balance sheets also allows the companies to raise bank loans. According to officials, GST frauds are only the tip of the iceberg, as aspects like IT evasion, money laundering, bank frauds, etc, follow.",fake firms,"Three persons have been arrested so far in order to prevent tampering of evidence, and Rs 20 crore tax has been realised.

214,GST fraud: Odisha firms avail Rs 4 crore with fake invoices,"By Express News Service

BHUBANESWAR: A GST fraud of over four crore rupees has come to light with two agro-based firms availing the amount from the Government as Input Tax Credit (ITC).

The agricultural implement manufacturing units submitted fake invoices without actual supply and receipt of goods.

The firms Annapurna Agro International Pvt Ltd and its sister company Subhamjyoti Agro Pvt Ltd availed ITC of Rs 3.29 crore on purchase of input worth Rs 18.31 crore and Rs 73 lakh on purchase of input worth Rs 4.03 crore respectively from six non-existent firms.

On the basis of intelligence inputs, the enforcement wing of Commissionerate of Central Tax and GST had inquired into business activities of a few companies, of which these six firms registered for supply of iron and steel goods were found to be non-existent.

The two firms showed fake purchase of raw materials like iron and steel worth Rs 22.33 crore without receipts and availed the ITC.

The two companies have made a total sale of Rs 209.56 crore between July 2017 and March 2019.

A GST official said premises of the units were raided recently and incriminating document were seized.

“The credibility of other purchases and supplies of the two firms is under investigation. Subhamjyoti Agro has, however, admitted to fraudulent practice and paid Rs 59 lakh as part payment of tax and penalty,” he said adding that though manufacturing and supply of goods are directly linked to physical procurement and utilisation of raw materials, the invoices were raised without actual supply or receipt of goods.

The enforcement wing also found 21 dealers from Koraput, Balangir, Jajpur, Berhampur, Balasore, Rourkela, Baripada, Barbil, Angul, Samblapur, Cuttack, Bargarh and Jharsuguda who had shown their purchase from the two companies. They are, however, suspected to be part of the nexus.

“As supply of agricultural implements is linked to subsidy, the possibility of availing subsidy on the basis of forged invoices cannot be ruled out,” the officer pointed out. Meanwhile, the Commissionerate of Central Tax and GST has asked the Agriculture department to inquire into the suspected transaction of agricultural implements by the two firms.

Agriculture Secretary Saurabh Garg, however, said GST fraud has no link with the department.

Express News Service

ROURKELA: Amid gaping holes in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system, the Rourkela Commissionerate of Central GST (CGST) and Excise department are witnessing an upsurge in tax evasion and fraud.

With the elimination of physical verification of business firms in the new GST regime coming as Godsend opportunity for the unscrupulous elements, the departments are visibly grappling to pick up frauds from the massive transaction volumes.

From October 2018 to May 2019, the CGST intelligence wing and Rourkela Commissionerate have detected three major frauds with the arrest of four local businessmen.

The errant traders, Kamal Paari, Manas Chandra Baral, Narayan Khaitan and Sanjiv Singh, were found to have duped the Central exchequer of a whopping Rs100.84 crore.

All are accused of issuing and receiving fake invoices through fake business firms with no real transactions and audaciously availing Input Tax Credit (ICT).

In March 2018, the officials had seized Rs 85 crore from some business firms involved in tax evasion while Rs 3 crore were recovered from other firms for non-filing of returns.

A senior CGST official pointed out that before the CGST regime, any business for registration had to submit authentic address and layout of their business point and godown along with fulfilling other paraphernalia which was followed up with physical verification.

This used to act as a deterrence. But in the new CGST regime, any dubious businessman can get registration with online uploading of documents.

Except in select cases, physical verification has been waived off, he mentioned.

Another official said most of the frauds are done by proprietorship firms registered with the CGST. The GST system itself is complex and in online monthly return filing involving voluminous transactions, fake documents get inserted to claim ICT.

The system does not automatically detect fake transactions. Any fake transaction could either be detected in a periodic audit or through careful scrutiny using extensive data analytics technology, he stated.

Former Rourkela MLA Pravat Mohapatra recently wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding a high-level inquiry into CGST frauds involving well-knit rackets.

Mohaptra claimed that many dubious producers and traders in steel, iron and minerals and other commodities have taken CGST registrations using their employees and faceless entities.

After committing fraud, the fake business firms get closed in six months, he pointed out.

219,GST fraud: Ghaziabad-based dealer arrested in Hyderabad for evading Rs 20.08 crore- The New Indian Express,"Rahul V Pisharody By

Express News Service

HYDERABAD: In a first, the Enforcement officers of the Telangana Commercial Taxes department arrested a Ghaziabad-based dealer for evading GST of Rs 20.08 crore.

Kaushik Shakthi Baburam was nabbed on August 23 and has been remanded to judicial custody for 14 days, ie; till September 5, 2019, after officials found out that the 35-year-old has floated 21 firms all over India, including the four in Telangana.

None of these were found to be existent or operational.

Of the 21 firms, 12 were registered with the GSTN on his name, 3 in his wife's name and 6 were registered in the name of his accomplice who is yet to be caught.

The sleuths who were keeping a watch on Baburam's activities for some time found out that he had registered his first company only in January 2019 and that he had registered his four companies in Telangana only since March 2019.

The case is seen to be peculiar because the sleuths detected inward as well as outward tax frauds.

Baburam has been operating from Delhi and sending goods to Telangana while trying to trick officials by creating a chain of firms in different states.

According to an official, huge loads of scrap metal is sent out from Telangana. Fake invoices worth Rs 150 crore is generated to avail input tax credit fraudulently.

That apart, various kinds of consumer goods from electrical goods, cupboard, stove were brought into the State without declaring sales. ""Name it and you have them. Huge number of goods are brought into Telangana but no sales are shown. They are also not available in any godowns, which means he has given it all away to various parties under zero,"" added the official.

Explaining further, he said, ""when goods are sent from Hyderabad to Delhi without paying IGST, it is a huge loss to the State as our share of IGST is gone to the other state.

Similarly, if goods are brought in without declaring them, there is a loss of CGST as well as SGST.""

The house owners of the rented principal place of business of all the fictitious business entities were confronted.

On such interrogation, all the rent agreements were found to be forged. Surprisingly, in two cases, the rent agreement signed during 2018 contained the forged signature of the house owners who had already died in the year 2006 and 2012. In many cases, banks accounts had been opened and operated by forging the signature of the account holders.

Investigation revealed that these masterminds, taking help from locals, collected identity documents from the innocent people of Kandhamal District assuring to facilitate them to avail benefits from Government scheme but mis-utilised the same for the purpose of taking GST registration and opening of current bank account in different banks.

The banking transactions in the name of the firms had been undertaken by the masterminds by mis-utilizing the signed cheque book and RTGS forms taken from the innocent persons in whose name registration had been taken fraudulently and in some cases by forging their signature.”

In order to regularize the sale of the goods purchased out of account, they arranged / manufactured fake purchase invoices in the name of fictitious firms created and operated by them and have utilized the said bogus ITC received on the strength of fake invoices while discharging the tax liability on supply of goods.

224,What India's Tax Reform Means For Trade Finance,"India recently embarked on an electronic invoice mandate initiative, with the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Custom (CBIC) introducing rules that require eInvoice adoption among corporates in an effort to curb goods and services tax (GST) evasion.

The country isn’t the first to turn to a digital invoice mandate as part of broader efforts to curb financial crime. But there are additional benefits to eInvoicing requirements and standardization beyond promoting tax compliance.

According to Sandeep Kakar, chief growth officer at India-based small business lending platform U GRO Capital, the mandate is promoting transparency in B2B trade, with significant implications for the supply chain financing space.

With the GST eInvoicing mandates, organizations are generating these digital documents straight from their enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, reducing reliance on human intervention. These invoices are critical to providers of trade finance, which must analyze the bills in order to underwrite a loan.

But one of the largest benefits of an eInvoicing mandate, Kakar told PYMNTS in a recent interview, is its ability to address one of the largest pain points in supply chain financing today: fraud.

Trade Finance Loopholes

There are a variety of ways fraud can derail the supply chain finance process. Among the most common strategies, Kakar explained, is manipulation of invoice amounts, or the practice of suppliers submitting duplicate invoices — one to their local bank, and one to an international bank — to receive double financing on the same bill.

This threat to financiers is due to “an age-old system of paper transactions,” he said.

There are strategies lenders have deployed to combat this risk, however. Know Your Customer (KYC) checks are critical to combatting invoice fraud, while Kakar also pointed to the practice of lenders analyzing historical transaction data of borrowers and their corporate customers to assess whether or not the invoice being submitted for trade financing follows a typical pattern of trade for that borrower.

However, these processes are often manual and error-prone, and aren’t able to address the entire scope of supply chain finance fraud risks.

“The chances of fraud are less, but this does not eliminate the chances of inflation or duplication,” noted Kakar, adding that what the GST eInvoice mandates can lead to is organizations generating their compliant invoices straight from their enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. That automation means minimal human intervention, and therefore less opportunity for someone to manipulate a document.

Technology Steps In

While electronic invoicing and automation can lower the supply chain finance fraud risk, Kakar also highlighted the opportunity for additional FinTech and emerging technologies to further safeguard financiers, while also opening up access to this valuable trade financing product for smaller businesses.

India’s eInvoice mandate and tax reform initiatives created the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN), a platform to support tax return filing and payments. The portal centralizes invoice details to further verify information for financiers in a much more automated and accurate way than verifying information on paper documents, said Kakar.

The nation’s tax reform has opened opportunities for enterprise technology providers to step in and promote compliance: EY and SAP, for example, announced last month the launch of a DigiGST tax compliance solution integrated into the SAP cloud platform to promote eInvoicing compliance. That ERP integration, as Kakar highlighted, also means less risk of document alterations for financiers.

For U GRO Capital, the eInvoice requirements open an opportunity to integrate into India’s tax network for automated document verification, with the company recently announcing its onboarding into the MonetaGo Invoice Fraud Prevention Network, a blockchain-powered platform to mitigate fraud risk.

Blockchain is also a promising technology in this arena to promote verified trade document data in a way that cannot be manipulated.

“The trends are very clear: people are looking at automation, simplification and scalability,” he noted.

For financiers, technology combatting invoice fraud is all about promoting transparency and mitigating risk. As a result, trade financing has become significantly more accessible to micro and small businesses across India, said Kakar, with lower risk yielding lower costs.

“When transparency is higher, financiers are looking at SMEs to finance their receivables,” he said, pointing to the tens of millions of micro enterprises across India, which accounts for massive contributions to manufacturing, exports and overall GDP.

“This is a very big, and very important segment which requires financing at a reasonable cost,” he continued. “Technology in supply chains will benefit these SMEs to raise money faster, and at a reasonable and attractive price as compared to the past.”",info,"The country isn’t the first to turn to a digital invoice mandate as part of broader efforts to curb financial crime.

Fraudsters created a fake network of 500 entities

The cases of fraud were detected with the help of data analytics which revealed that the fraudsters had created a network of over 500 entities comprising fake billers, intermediary dealers, distributors and bogus manufacturers of hawai chappals for availing and encashing fake ITC in Uttarakhand. These fake manufacturers were then making supplies to other fictitious entities and retailers in three states including Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.

The raw material for the chappals, known as Ethylene-vinyl acetate attracts 18 per cent GST, whereas ready chappals are charged 5 per cent GST, which allowed the manufacturers to claim a refund of the inverted duty structure in cash.

Similarly, in Uttarakhand, the fraudsters had created over rs 600 crore of 'fake credit' which they would have continued to encash had the fraud not been busted. The main accused in this case was arrested in December and was sent to judicial custody.

226,"1MDB-linked corruption trial closes, with defence saying Najib was victim of a scam","KUALA LUMPUR - The corruption trial of Malaysia's former premier Najib Razak relating to funds misappropriated from SRC International, a former subsidiary of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), has finally closed, with the judge setting July 28 for a verdict. The trial began in April last year.

The defence has pinned the blame on elusive financier Low Taek Jho, otherwise known as Jho Low, calling Najib a ""victim of a scam"".

Led by Shafee Abdullah - himself on trial for money-laundering and tax evasion - the defence has maintained that Low mismanaged Najib's accounts.

""It has become complicated for us to produce the best defence because Datuk Seri Najib is a victim of a scam, and misrepresentation by Jho Low and Nik Faisal,"" Shafee told the Kuala Lumpur High Court in his closing submissions this week. He was referring to Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, former chief executive officer of SRC International.

""There is not an iota of evidence that he was involved in causing the funds to be transacted,"" said Shafee on Friday (June 5) of Najib.

Defence lawyers presented their final rebuttal of the prosecution's charge this week from Monday, bringing to an end the closely watched trial, one of several involving the former prime minister.

Said Judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali on Friday: ""This court has over the whole of this week heard submissions by both defence and prosecution, and also lengthy and extensive, albeit in parts repetitive, written submissions, which in total run close to 2,000 pages. This will nevertheless assist this court… to evaluate and determine whether the prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt.""

Najib, 66, faces seven charges of misappropriating RM42 million (S$13.7 million) of public funds, comprising three counts of criminal breach of trust, three counts of money laundering, and one count of abuse of power.

He has claimed that billions of ringgit he allegedly received in his bank accounts between 2011 and 2014 when he was prime minister and finance minister were donations from Saudi Arabia's royal family, and not public funds.

But the prosecution has said that the money came from government-linked companies, including RM42 million traced back to SRC International.

SRC, previously described as ""a two-dollar company"" by the prosecution, as it was formed with a paid-up capital of RM2, had received from the civil servants' pension fund KWAP RM4 billion in loans guaranteed by the Finance Ministry, when Najib was both premier and finance minister.

Both Low and Nik Faisal are still at large.

""What is fascinating is that the accused said he did not look at his account for five years,"" said lead prosecutor V. Sithambaram of Najib.

""Ordinarily, even if a multi-millionaire says he did not know that RM42 million came into his accounts, he would be laughed out of court,"" said Datuk Sithambaram.

The prosecutor also pointed out that when Najib removed Nik Faisal as the chief executive officer of SRC amid complaints about financial misconduct, he allowed him to remain as a signatory to SRC accounts.

""Although Nik Faisal was removed as the CEO, he wasn't removed as the company's signatory and mandate holder of Najib's accounts. Why was he not removed? This was because Najib wanted Nik Faisal to control both accounts, so that he could facilitate the millions going in from SRC,"" he told the court.

This is the first time in Malaysian history that a former prime minister has been charged in court, in what is the first of five trials involving Najib, following revelations that billions misappropriated from 1MDB had found their way into Najib's accounts for his personal and political expenses.

The court had heard that some purchases made using the RM42 million of SRC funds included RM3.3 million spent on purchases at Swiss luxury jeweller De Grisogono in Italy, more than RM466,000 on a Chanel watch, and hotel stays worth over RM200,000 in three cities.

A total of 57 prosecution and 19 defence witnesses, including Najib, had testified in the trial.

If found guilty of criminal breach of trust, Najib faces a maximum imprisonment of 20 years and a fine.

On the charge of abuse of power, he faces imprisonment for up to 20 years and a fine of at least five times the amount or value of the bribe or RM10,000, whichever is higher.

If found guilty of money-laundering, Najib faces up to 15 years' imprisonment and a fine of up to five times the sum of the illicit proceeds or RM5 million, whichever is higher, on each count.

Najib faces a total of 42 counts for corruption, money-laundering and abuse of power spanning five different cases tied to 1MDB.

A guilty verdict would bar him from contesting a general election within five years.

The prosecution said on Friday that it expects the case to be completed within a year, following appeals to the appellate and federal courts.",NA,"The defence has pinned the blame on elusive financier Low Taek Jho, otherwise known as Jho Low, calling Najib a ""victim of a scam"".

They had allegedly issued electronic Tourist Refund Scheme (eTRS) tickets which allowed claimants to fraudulently claim GST cash refunds.

In a statement, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) said that in a ruse involving jewellery, a tourist would pay local customers - who are not entitled to eTRS refunds - for their jewellery invoices.

By using these invoices and his or her passport, the tourist would obtain eTRS tickets from the retailer.

""The tourist would then claim eTRS GST cash refunds at a port of departure using the purchased invoices, the eTRS tickets obtained from the retailer, and a different jewellery, which he would have separately prepared,"" said Iras.

""In actual fact, the tourist would not be entitled to the eTRS refund, as he was not the actual purchaser of the jewellery referred to in the invoices,"" it added.

Iras investigators arrested the men on Thursday.

On Friday, all of them except Palaniappan were offered bail of $5,000 each. The Singaporean's bail was set at $10,000.

All seven men will be back in court on March 29.

Iras has stressed that it takes a serious view of such fraudulent GST refund claims and will not hesitate to take stern enforcement action against any individuals or parties involved.

228,Over $7m lost to scammers posing as tech support staff,"More than $7 million has been lost to scammers posing as technical support staff in the first four months of this year, an increase of more than 40 times from the same period last year.

The scammers deceive victims into believing their Internet connections have been compromised.

Victims lost some $3.2 million in April alone, when circuit breaker measures were in full force and more people were working or learning from home.

One victim was cheated of $958,500, the highest sum lost in a single case from January to April.

Similar scams had defrauded people of $169,600 from January to April last year, said the police yesterday.

Around 70 per cent of victims were aged 40 to 75, said the police, adding that scammers typically persuade their victims to install software applications like TeamViewer or AnyDesk, under the pretext that this would solve the connection problems.

But once the applications are installed, the scammers would have remote access to the victims' computers and can transfer money out of their bank accounts.

Some fraudsters use a similar tactic by pretending to be with the ""Cyber Crime Department of Singapore"" or the ""Cyber Police of Singapore"" - both of which are non-existent organisations.

Victims are told that they have ""committed an offence"", and must download the applications to help in investigations, said the police.

Criminologist Olivia Choy from Nanyang Technological University said there is a greater chance of people becoming victims when they are often with their devices, and this has been more pronounced as people rely even more on devices to communicate with others during the circuit breaker.

""We are all on our devices these days - that's how the majority of people are communicating with one another. So these problems are going to be more prominent and significant,"" she said.

Victims said scammers are often very convincing, and are quick to ""verify"" their own identities and allay further concerns.

A 61-year-old Singapore permanent resident, who wanted to be known only as Bavara, was contacted by a man purporting to be from Singtel in mid-April, a week into the circuit breaker period.

Without prompting, the man offered his name, his ""employee ID"" number and a telephone number, before informing Ms Bavara that her IP address had been compromised, she said.

The man then referred her to another person, who claimed to be with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore. They needed her assistance in tracking down hackers, she was told.

At their behest, she downloaded the TeamViewer app, and they told her that they needed to make a ""fake transaction"" with her bank account to track down the hackers.

When she raised concerns, they reassured her that she would be reimbursed, even producing a letter of authorisation from her bank, she said.

""The impersonator was very confident, polite, knowledgeable. I asked all kinds of questions and he had good answers to everything,"" said Ms Bavara, who runs a business development consultancy service.

""I was pretty much overwhelmed with all the details,"" she said, adding that the circuit breaker had added to her anxiety.

The scammers attempted to siphon off $170,000. Fortunately, her bank spotted something fishy and stopped some of the transactions, she said.

Ms Bavara realised she had been tricked only when the police called her to find out more about the suspicious transactions flagged by the bank. In the end, she was swindled out of around $94,000, as some transactions were not stopped in time.

229,Pompeo calls Nasdaq's strict rules a model to guard against fraudulent Chinese companies,"WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday (June 4) warned American investors against 'fraudulent' accounting practices of China-based companies and said the Nasdaq's recent decision to tighten listing rules for such players should be a model for all other exchanges around the world.

His remarks on the issue, reported first by Reuters before being delivered via a statement, illustrate the Trump administration's desire to make it harder for some Chinese companies to trade on exchanges outside of China.

It also represents the latest flashpoint in the relationship between Washington and Beijing at a time of escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies over trade, the coronavirus pandemic as well as a spat over Hong Kong.

""American investors should not be subjected to hidden and undue risks associated with companies that do not abide by the same rules as US firms,"" Mr Pompeo said in a statement. ""Nasdaq's action should serve as a model for other exchanges in the United States, and around the world.""

""I applaud Nasdaq for requiring auditing firms to ensure all listed companies comply with international reporting and inspection standards,"" Mr Pompeo said.

China said on Friday that forcing Chinese firms to retreat from US stock exchanges would severely harm US interests.

In a briefing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang also accused Washington of making hasty generalisations about China-based companies’ accounting practices.

Nasdaq Inc took action last month and tightened listing rules, in a bid to curb initial public offerings of Chinese companies closely held by insiders and with opaque accounting.

Nasdaq chief executive Adena Friedman said on Thursday addressing the overseas accounting issues is a matter for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The exchange's tightening of listing standards came after Chinese coffeehouse chain Luckin Coffee Inc, which had a US IPO in early 2019, announced that an internal investigation showed its chief operating officer and other employees fabricated sales deals.

President Donald Trump last Friday said his administration would begin the process of eliminating special US treatment for Hong Kong to punish China, saying Beijing's move to impose new national security legislation meant the territory no longer warranted US economic privileges.

He also said he was instructing a presidential working group to study the differing practices of Chinese companies listed on the US financial markets, with the goal of protecting American investors.

""The real issue is the lack of transparency and the lack of disclosure to the American investors,"" Mr Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the US State Department, told Reuters on Wednesday.

""No country should be allowed to lie to the American investors to create an unfair advantage, especially when operating in American markets,"" Mr Krach said, adding that there was a push within the administration to make US investors more aware about China's opaque accounting practices.

Related Story Nasdaq cracks down on IPOs of small Chinese companies

As a result of the US pressure, many US-listed Chinese firms will likely list on the Hong Kong exchange this year in part because of US political pressure, the head of the exchange said Thursday.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been locked in a decade-long struggle with the Chinese government to inspect audits of US-listed Chinese companies. The regulator's accounting oversight arm, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), is still unable to access those critical records, it has said.

In April, the head of the SEC, Mr Jay Clayton, warned investors against putting money into Chinese companies due to ongoing problems with those companies' disclosures.

A senior US official said he hoped the SEC would review a 2013 memorandum of understanding signed with China to allow Chinese companies to not share information if their local laws forbid them from doing so.

""That waiver should probably be reviewed at this point in time as to whether it is still appropriate and if not be rescinded,"" he said, adding that the decision was up to the SEC.",NA,"""American investors should not be subjected to hidden and undue risks associated with companies that do not abide by the same rules as US firms,"" Mr Pompeo said in a statement.

235,Chhattisgarh HC rejects writ petition of alleged issuer of Fake Invoices [Read Order],"The Chhattisgarh High Court rejected a writ petition filed by a trader who was penalised for allegedly purchasing goods from bogus dealers and thereby issuing fake invoices for availing input tax credit.

The petitioner, Dadhichi Iron, and Steel are engaged in the business of trading of iron and steel items. They purchase goods from steel manufacturers and sell the same to the different customers in different parts of the country. According to the counsel for the petitioner, the petitioner pays GST on the goods purchased from the manufacturers and further pays GST on the value of the supply of said goods made at the time of sale being made by the petitioner to other customers.

According to them, they were entitled to the Input Tax Credit on the GST paid on the goods and services purchased. The respondents initially commenced an investigation against the petitioner on the allegation of the petitioner allegedly purchasing goods from bogus dealers and thereby issuing Chhattisgarh HC fake invoices and a notice in this regard was issued to the petitioner, based upon which subsequently the Input Tax Credit available to the petitioner was blocked and thereafter a proceeding was drawn in-respect-of the illegal availing of the Input Tax Credit. The said notice was subjected to challenge in a Writ Petition which this court disposed-off directing the petitioner to file a detailed representation/objection to the concerned authorities under the department, who in turn was further directed to take-into-consideration the contents of the representation/objection and decide the same

Justice P. Sam Koshy while rejecting the writ petition held, “ having heard the contentions put forth on either side and on perusal of record and also taking note of the provisions of the Act what clearly reflects is that the initial issuance of the show cause notice and the proceedings drawn were in respect of the intrastate transactions made by the petitioner, wherein he had used fake and bogus invoices for the purpose of availing ineligible ITC, whereas subsequent to a secret information being received and further investigation being made, particularly in the course of a raid, which was conducted at the premises of the petitioner-establishment and other related premises, it was revealed that the magnitude of the offence committed by the petitioner-establishment was far more grave and serious. It was in the course of raid found that the petitioner had been making false and bogus transactions and has illegally availed ineligible ITC credits”.

The Court also said that, “The magnitude of which detected by now is approximately Rs.60 crores and with further investigation, the amount is likely to increase manifold. This Court does not find any substance in the arguments of the petitioner when they say that the investigation and the proceedings now initiated is one, which hit by Section 6(2)(1)(b) of the CGST Act of 2017. What has also to be appreciated is the fact that there is a clear distinction between a proceeding drawn for the demand of tax evaded by the petitioner-establishment and the investigation be conducted by the Department of the DG, GST Intelligence Wings in respect of an offence committed by an establishment by way of using bogus and fake invoices and illegally availing ITC, which the petitioner-establishment otherwise was ineligible.”",other,"The Chhattisgarh High Court rejected a writ petition filed by a trader who was penalised for allegedly purchasing goods from bogus dealers and thereby issuing fake invoices for availing input tax credit.

237,GST Evasion: DGGI unearths Input Tax Credit Fraud of over Rs 400 crore in Kandla SEZ,"Acting on specific intelligence that a few units located in Kandla SEZ at Gandhidham, (Gujarat) in connivance with about 20 exporter firms/companies based in the National Capital Region (NCR) have hatched a major conspiracy to defraud the Government exchequer, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), Ahmedabad Zone (an Investigative arm of the Central Government), has initiated investigations by conducting searches in three units located in SEZ and thereafter at the premises of NCR based exporters and their godowns.

The modus operandi detected indicates huge overvaluation to the extent of 3000% of the market value of goods exported to the SEZ (zero-rated supply) and claiming of refund of Input Tax Credit (ITC) obtained by fraudulent means. Evidence confirming that the source of ITC claimed as a refund against exports itself is fraudulent.

In what seems to be a meticulously planned conspiracy, the commodity selected by the entities for the fraudulent act has been found to be sin goods viz “manufactured tobacco and other related products” falling under CTH 2403 which is subject to tax at the rate of 93% and 188%, including Cess. Due to high incidence of taxes on such goods the scope to claim refunds of ITC against refunds is manifold more than the goods which are subject to tax at lower rate of 28% or 18%. Thus, the conspirators have aimed at deriving maximum illegal gain out of fraudulent transactions. It is noteworthy to mention that tobacco products are mostly Business to Consumer (B2C) supply items and it is relatively easier to obtain from the market GST paid invoices without corresponding goods, as the goods often get sold in the market without corresponding bills.

It has been revealed that low grade material like scented jarda, kimam (tobacco extract), filter khaini etc. which have been manufactured clandestinely without payment of tax by a few Noida based units or procured from the local market at the rate of Rs. 150 to 350 per kg have been exported to the SEZ based units at the rate of Rs. 5000 to 9000 per kg and subsequently, refund of accumulated ITC, sourced fraudulently, in excess of Rs. 400 crores has been claimed by the exporters from the jurisdictional GST authorities.

The agency has been able to identify more than 25 such suppliers located in States like Assam, Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, MP and UP who have issued fake invoices of more than Rs.1000 crores to the NCR based exporters without supply of goods to facilitate refunds. These suppliers are either non-existent or are being indirectly controlled by the exporters themselves.

To give a semblance of legitimacy to the otherwise sham transactions, low value goods manufactured in Noida or procured locally in Delhi have been dispatched to SEZ units under the cover of invoices. Thus, while the Input Tax Credit has been obtained fraudulently from one source, the low value goods have been procured from another source and both the streams have converged at the end of exporters who have made highly overvalued supplies to the SEZ units for illegal gains through ITC refund route.

Due to the proactive steps taken by the DGGI, refund claims of ITC in excess of Rs. 300 crores in the process of getting disbursed by the jurisdictional authorities, have been withheld from going into the hands of scamesters.

In addition, the surplus ITC of more than Rs 100 crores still lying in the credit ledger of such exporters has also been prevented from getting siphoned off by way of likely refunds claims. Thus, an act of indiscretion has been nipped in the bud.

The illegitimate export incentives availed by the SEZ units shall also be further investigated by the Customs Authorities.

The agency has been able to identify the key conspirators and the actual beneficiaries of the scam who are on the run. Efforts are being made to bring them to the book.

This is a major detection of export fraud coupled with fraudulent ITC refunds though SEZ based units. This investigation is an outcome of specific intelligence input which was further refined by rigorous analysis of data available on the GST Network and the E-way Bill system.

The case is indicative of the resolve of DGGI to implement the directives of the Government to ensure tax compliance and to strive to provide a level playing field to the honest entrepreneurs who are the wealth creators of the Nation.",other,"which have been manufactured clandestinely without payment of tax by a few Noida based units or procured from the local market at the rate of Rs.

238,GST Evasion: Firm busted for claiming bogus Input Tax Credit worth Rs 281 Crores,"The Central Goods and Services Tax ( CGST ), Meerut has busted firm for claiming the bogus Input Tax Credit ( ITC ) worth Rs. 281 crores.

In an investigation led by CGST Meerut team has prima facie revealed issuance of GST invoices of Rs. 1,708 crores from a chain fake firms/companies operating from Delhi, Moradabad and Meerut, involving bogus Input Tax Credit ITC of about Rs 281 crores. The fraud amount may exceed on the further probe.

On the basis of the initiative taken by the Chief Commissioner, Meerut, Data Analytics team analysed suspected firms. They passed on information on the basis of which CGST Meerut unearthed a case of issuance of fake GST invoices without actual supply of goods and passing on the said fraudulent ITC to the other existing firms after circulation of invoices through a chain of fake firms/ companies which are non-existing. These firms/ companies were operating from a small Janta Flat in Rohini Sector-6, New Delhi.

The modus operandi, inter alia, involved not only creating fake firms/ companies by misusing the IDs of different people but also purchasing non-active companies from others and getting the names of directors changed and using these for fake GST billing purposes. Before passing the ITC to ultimate business buyers, ITC was rotated multiple times among the non-existing firms and companies to make it difficult to find the trail. Against these fake invoices, ITC was passed on to existing firms/ companies for further utilization in the payment of GST. The end recipients from these fake firms made payment through Bank which was subsequently withdrawn and returned back to those end recipients in cash after deduction of certain commission. On preliminary scrutiny, it appeared that the accused namely Shri Pradeep Kumar (kingpin) and his associates Shri Mohd. Shamshad and Shri Mohd. Sajjad had taken multiple GST Registrations at the common address using common email ID and mobile number.

During the search conducted at Meerut, Moradabad and Delhi, incriminating records, cash of Rs. 9.56 lakhs, flex boards of several firms, rubber stamps of various firms/ companies, digital signature dongles, Credit / Debit Cards with different names, photographs, Bank chequebooks, PAN cards etc. have been recovered & seized.

240,GST Evasion: CGST Delhi East busts Firms utilizing Fraudulent ITC worth Rs. 24 cr,"Officers of Anti-Evasion, Central GST Commissionerate, Delhi East, have unravelled an operation involving availing of fraudulent Input Tax Credit on the basis of fake invoices and evasion of GST by utilizing the said fraudulent ITC to the tune of Rs. 24 crores approx. by M/s Shub Conductors LLP. An investigation was initiated against M/s Shub Conductors LLP on intelligence that the firm had been availing fraudulent ITC on the basis of fake invoices raised by fictitious suppliers.

Searches were conducted in the premises of M/s Shub Conductors LLP along with the suppliers suspected of being fake. It was found that among other firms, M/s Een Een Sales Corporation and M/s A.N. Marketing had passed on fake ITC to M/s Shub Conductors.

During the investigation, Shri Naresh Goel and Shri Anil Kumar Yadav, proprietors of M/s Een Een Sales Corporation and M/s A.N. Marketing respectively, agreed to have passed on fraudulent ITC to M/s Shub Conductors LLP, among other parties, by raising fake invoices without actual supply of goods.

The suppliers of M/s Een Een Sales Corporation and M/s A.N. Marketing were also found to be non-existent. Consequently, both Shri Naresh Goel and Shri Mil Kumar Yadav were arrested under Section 69(1) of the CGST Act, 2017, on 29.01.2020 and remanded to judicial custody.

The investigation further revealed that at least 7 firms were floated in the names of fictitious entities for the sole purpose of creating a complex network of transactions among themselves, including the transfer of money in bank accounts to make them appear genuine. This enabled them to raise fake invoices to manufacturers such as M/s Shub Conductors LLP, who availed the fraudulent Input Tax Credit without actual receipt of goods. The money received in Bank accounts was then withdrawn and routed back in cash to the recipients. Thus, the operation involved not only violation of GST law but also laundering of money.

Searches were conducted in the business of M/s Shub Conductors LLP, as /1well as the residential premises of the partners, fond namely, Shri Vishal Gupta and his wife, Smt. Divya Gupta. The partners were not to be present in either of the locations. Thereafter both the partners who are authorized signatories in the firm repeatedly evaded summons issued by the department, with the deliberate intention of hindering the investigation. The partners also absconded for more than one month.

During the course of the investigation, residential property and 6 vehicles owned by Shri Vishal Gupta and Smt. Divya Gupta along with the bank accounts of M/s Shub Conductors LLP were provisionally attached under Section 83 of the CGST Act, 2017.

He also refused to divulge the location of his wife and partner in M/s Shub Conductors LLP, Smt. Divya Gupta, who remains absconding till date.

Shri Vishal Gupta, Partner in M/s Shub Conductors LLP appeared to have knowingly committed an offence under the provisions of Section 132(1)(c) of the Central Goods & Services Tax Act (CGST), 2017, which is a cognizable and non-bailable offence, punishable under Section 132(5) of the CGST Act, 2017.

252,Punjab and Haryana HC grants Bail to Advocate allegedly involved in GST Scam [Read Order],"The Punjab and Haryana High Court has granted bail to an Advocate who was allegedly involved in registering bogus firms for performing GST scam.

A secret information was received about the applicants Rajesh Mittal, Inder Partap Singh and Manish that they were creating bogus firms and by transacting with bigger firms, they were getting huge amounts of money deposited in the account numbers of the said fake bogus firms so as to save GST and are thus causing huge loss to the State Exchequer on account of loss of revenue. The information further contained that the accused were moving about in a car along with laptops and were waiting for someone near T-point railway line grain market., Chandni Bagh, Panipat District. The police swung into action and were able to apprehend the aforesaid accused Rajesh Mittal, Inder Pratap Singh and Manish. On searching the car, Laptops, Cheque Books, Fake stamps of ETO, Fake rubber-stamps of DTC and Files of bogus firms were also recovered.

The car was found to be registered in the name of Vipul Jindal, who happens to be ‘jija’ (brother-in-law) of Rajesh Mittal. During the course of the investigation, the police were able to unearth the entire racket of evasion of GST. It was found that Rajesh Mittal was the kingpin who issued bogus bills purported to have been issued by one M/s Lalit Trading Company, which was in fact out of business. Such bogus bills were issued in favour of 18 firms in respect of a bogus transaction of sale of yarn. The said 18 firms had been got incorporated/registered by associating persons of the status of rickshaw pullers etc. and were not actually businessmen. It was further found that in the bills issued by M/s Lalit Trading Company in favour of the said 18 bogus firms (non-functional firms), GST was also shown to have been charged.

The Advocate arrested in connection, Satnarain, had submitted that his services were hired by Rajesh Mittal for the purpose of getting some firms registered and he had rendered professional consultancy and assistance in the matter of incorporation/ registration of firms and had charged some nominal professional fee which cannot be said to be part and parcel of the alleged scam of evasion of GST.

Justice Guruvinder Singh Gill while disposing of the petition held, “In view of the aforesaid discussion, the complicity of the kingpin Rajesh Mittal and also of Manish, owner of M/s Ansh Hospitality and of petitioner Inder Partap Singh, owner of M/s Shree Bala Ji Wooltax, is clearly evident. Keeping in view the enormity of the scam and the colossal loss caused to the State exchequer, which has lost GST, this Court does not find any ground for grant of bail. The petitions on their behalf, as such, are dismissed. As far as the petitioner Satnarain is concerned, it is not disputed that he is an Advocate by profession. It appears that he had rendered his professional services and assistance for the purpose of incorporation of the firms. At this stage, it cannot be said that he had joined hands with Rajesh Mittal or as the beneficiary of any amount other than his professional fee. In any case, since he has already been behind bars since the last about 8 months, his further detention will not serve any useful purpose. The petition on his behalf, as such, is accepted and the petitioner-Satnarain is ordered to be released on regular bail on his furnishing bail bonds/surety bonds to the satisfaction of learned trial Court/Chief Judicial Magistrate/Duty Magistrate concerned.”

254,Telangana HC denies Anticipatory Bail on allegations of Non-Issuance of Invoices [Read Order],"The Telangana High Court has recently denied anticipatory bail to the co-accused persons of a GST fraud case.

The accused, his wife and son are directors of the Company, Transworld Educare Private Limited. After investigation, the intelligence wing of the department found that the company is providing taxable services i.e., consultation services without raising GST invoices and also not paying appropriate GST on the same resulting in loss of revenue to the government exchequer. It was alleged that the company had been indulged in the suppression of details in the returns filed by them.

On apprehending an arrest by the department for serious violation of GST provisions, the petitioners approached the forum seeking anticipatory bail on the ground that both the petitioners were not even aware of the activities being run by the main accused.

255,Amit Mitra seeks probe into GST ‘fraud’,"In a letter written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Mitra urged to put in place ‘a robust reporting system’ to generate real time tax alerts on detection of any suspicious and fraudulent transaction going forward. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta

Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra has demanded a thorough investigation to detect the ‘massive fraud’ under Goods & Services Tax (GST) and take action against ‘racketeers’, as India grapples with tax evasion under the new indirect tax regime.

In a letter written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Mitra urged to put in place ‘a robust reporting system’ to generate real time tax alerts on detection of any suspicious and fraudulent transaction going forward.

Drawing attention to a reply of Anurag Thakur, minister of state for finance, where he admitted that Rs 45,682 crore of tax fraud has been detected under GST since the rollout on July 1, 2017, Mitra said the new return system should be in place with invoice matching ‘without fail’.

“In fact, this massive fraud under GST is understated, as complete data of frauds under state GST (SFST) have not been factored in. If the detected and undetected cases of tax fraud of all states under SGST are compiled, then the tax evasion figure may cross Rs 1 lakh crore,” Mitra wrote in the letter.

The GST Council, the apex body comprising representatives of states and the Centre, is slated to meet on September 20 in Goa, where the issue of tax evasion may come up. A new return system is going to be in place from October 1 (for large tax payers) and January 2020 (for all tax payers).

Tax dodgers appear to be taking advantage of a lack of invoice matching in the system. Even though the leak proof system were to be in place initially, the IT backbone could not take the load of the gargantuan volume of transactions.

“The concept of invoice matching is the core of GST as there is a two-way flow of credit between the Centre and the state and between states. We could not even start invoice matching as GSTR-2 return, through which it was possible, has not been introduced.

“Despite not having an invoice matching facility, dealers were allowed to claim input tax credit (ITC). As there were no means to check the veracity and genuineness of the claimed GST, there are widespread tax frauds and hawala transactions,” Mitra wrote.

The Bengal finance minister, who was the chairman of the empowered committee of finance ministers on GST, has been a vocal critic of what he called a hurried and unplanned introduction of GST without creating a robust backend IT infrastructure.

In his letter to the finance minister on August 27, 2019, Mitra also highlighted a recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).

“The CAG in its report recently placed in the Lok Sabha has flagged the same issue that the existing GST system is vulnerable to fraudulent ITC claims. In its report, it has stated that invoice matching is the critical requirement that would yield the full benefits of the tax reform,” he wrote.

Expert view

Experts feel that while the rollout of GST, where several levies were subsumed to under one, was commendable, the government could have taken more time to introduce the IT-based system.

“We need to look at GST, the tax and GSTN, the IT backbone, separately. While the tax reform was the need of the hour, more precaution could have been taken before asking everyone to file everything online. A gradual transition to the IT-based system for such a massive country may have helped reduce the inconvenience, cost of compliance and fraud,” Santosh Dalvi, partner and deputy head of indirect taxes, KPMG, said.

Parag Mehta, partner at chartered accountant firm NA Shah Associates, cautioned about the new tax filing regime effective October 1.

“In the new forms that are being introduced, the sellers will upload their entire sales. Based on the reported sales, only the buyers will be allowed ITC. If their purchases are not reported, the buyer will be allowed to report the same to a particular percentage and claim ITC. This would ensure that all traders report their correct and complete sales,” Mehta said.

However, the point of concern would be that in case of defaults by sellers, the genuine buyers will be penalised by restricting their ITC on such unreported sales, he noted. Steps should be taken to penalise evaders and not a genuine businessman, he added.",info,"Picture by Bishwarup DuttaBengal finance minister Amit Mitra has demanded a thorough investigation to detect the ‘massive fraud’ under Goods & Services Tax (GST) and take action against ‘racketeers’, as India grapples with tax evasion under the new indirect tax regime.

256,Fake GST registrations found in ‘evasion-prone’ commodities,"Across nearly a dozen commodities that have been considered evasion-prone, the Commercial Taxes Department has found out 285 newly registered taxpayers having obtained GST registrations fictitiously by submitting false or fabricated documents in the past four months alone. In all these cases, which were found during physical verifications, the taxpayers were non existent.

The action comes after the department deployed physical verification for the first time to identify such fraudulent GST registrations in the light of numerous instances of fraud that have been detected post GST.

Across trades

The verifications were taken up in trades, including areca, readymade garments, granite, marbles and tiles, electrical and electronic goods, iron and steel, cement, plywood and timber, automobile parts and hardware, among other things.

“Based on our past experience, we decided to physically verify the proof and address and identity of new registrations in evasion-prone commodities. Of the 4,935 dealers inspected between April and July, we found 285 taxpayers obtaining registrations by submitting false or fabricated documents. Some taxpayers did not exist too,” Commissioner of Commercial Taxes M.S. Srikar told The Hindu. Steps have been initiated to cancel these registrations, he added.

In the past two years, the department has also cancelled about 43,300 registrations, including tax defaulters and bogus registrations. Since the GST rollout, there have been about 3 lakh new registrations, taking the total to 8 lakh registered taxpayers in the State from about 5 lakh in the VAT era.

Under the GST regime, registrations for new taxpayers are granted within three working days without any physical verification of the business premises and without ascertaining the veracity of documents uploaded by taxpayers. “This facility was extended to have ease of doing business. However, we found several cases of bogus e-way bill and input credit among others being created,” he added.

Physical verification

The physical verification, he said, would continue for all new registrations, and an exclusive android app has been developed by NIC to enable officers to upload information. Mr. Srikar also said that the department has been initiating action against those taxpayers who have purchased from non-existent taxpayers to disallow the input tax credit claims. “The transport of goods using e-way bills generated by newly registered taxpayers or their suppliers dealing in the evasion prone commodities have been kept under the watch list of the eway bill system,” he said.

Commercial lease/rent under scanner

In its bid to increase GST collections in the State, the Commercial Taxes Department is looking into commercial properties in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike region. The department has received information of about one lakh commercial properties based on property tax details. Under the GST regime, lease or rent on the property attracts a tax at the rate of 18%.

“We have started verifying these properties to understand the compliance rate. Many are self-owned or have a rent or lease of less than ?20 lakh, categories which are exempted from GST,” Mr. Srikar said. “Though there has been compliance, the full understanding will be known in a few months. Officers are physically verifying the properties for compliance,” he added. He added that they will obtain transaction registration details from the Department of Registrations. PAN will help monitor tax compliance better, he added.",other,"Across nearly a dozen commodities that have been considered evasion-prone, the Commercial Taxes Department has found out 285 newly registered taxpayers having obtained GST registrations fictitiously by submitting false or fabricated documents in the past four months alone.

258,?543 cr. GST scam busted,"Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), Chennai Zonal Unit, has busted an alleged ?543 crore fake invoices scam and arrested the kingpin behind it.

The officials conducted searches in Hosur on January 24 and busted a module involved in issuing invoices without supplying goods, according to a release.

“Several incriminating documents, including copies of fake invoices issued on the letter heads of several firms which existed merely on paper were seized,” it added.

According to preliminary estimates, the DGGI said that ever since July 2017, invoices covering goods worth over ?543 crore were issued by the mastermind and his accomplices in the name of as many as eight different bogus firms, floated for this purpose. These invoices were never accompanied by goods, thereby passing off about ?98 crore of ineligible income tax credit to various other tax payers. Further investigations are on, it added.

Explaining the modus operandi, the DGGI said some unscrupulous persons created several bogus companies and opened bank accounts in their name using Aadhar cards and PANs of employees and friends, and the same were used to obtain GST registration.

“Subsequently, a number of transactions was created between such bogus firms, without actual supply/movement of goods. The entire racket revolves around circular trading and passing on input tax credit to various customers without actual supply of goods, ” the release said.

It further added that evidence gathered suggested that companies operating in Pune and Bengaluru have benefited from such tax invoices and availed fraudulent input tax credit.

259,GST officials unearth fake invoice cases,"Officials of the Central GST Commissionerate here have detected issue of fake invoices without supply of goods.

A release from Principal Commissioner (GST) Rajesh Sodhi said investigations were initiated against three units - Aliya Enterprises, Vinayak Trading and Star International - and it was found that these units were doing only bill (invoice) trading without supply of goods. Mohamed Ariff was the main conspirator behind the bill trading. These invoices were used by several scrap dealers. Tax amount in the bill trading was availed as input tax credit and used for further bill trading. This was estimated to have resulted in ?40 crore loss to the government in terms of revenue.

It was further found that about 15 entities had supplied invoices and more than 50 entities to whom these invoices had been sold. The money trail was also under investigation. The release said that the modus operandi used by these entities was that after the sale of invoice, the recipient transferred the proceeds, including GST, by banking channels. After receipt of consideration, the accused retained the commission, which varied between 10 % to 12 % and refunded the balance in cash.

The total cash withdrawals by the petitioner was about ?60 crore and the balance turnover done by the petitioner was about ?170 crore and it was not through banking channels. The Department had attached the suspicious bank accounts of the petitioner.

The main accused had approached the High Court and was ordered by it to deposit ?5 crore and co-operate with the investigation. Mohamed Ariff paid ?2 crore and approached the Supreme Court to relax the condition for granting bail. The Supreme Court issued orders last month, asking him to pay the remaining ?3 crore. However, he failed to pay the amount within the stipulated time. He was arrested and remanded in judicial custody.

260,"Tax dept detects ?50 crore GST ‘fraud’, files complaint","The Delhi government’s Trade and Taxes Department has detected a fraud of ?50 crore by a businessman who allegedly used forged documents, incorrectly claimed input tax credit (ITC) under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime and passed some of it along to other businesses.

The Department’s Commissioner, H. Rajesh Prasad, said on Wednesday that the department had filed a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing of the Delhi police in connection with the fraud.

A complaint dated October 12 stated that the accused, Pankaj Chawla, proprietor of Kavita Industries, allegedly defrauded the government by using fake documents, falsely claiming ITC without being eligible and transferring ?15 crore in ITC to other traders. The remaining credit of ?35 crore had been suspended by the department when it learned of the fraud, the commissioner said.

ITC of ?47.46 crore

The complaint noted that after the GST replaced the earlier Value Added Tax (VAT) regime from July 1, 2017, the accused claimed a total ITC of ?47.46 crore, a large figure that had to be verified by an inspector.

On June 22, when the inspector visited the Wazirpur address given by the accused for signing up for the GST portal, it was found that no such company existed there.

The inspector then visited two residential addresses associated with the company and found that both were non-existent.

The department then sent a request to Karnataka Bank, in which the accused had declared an account, to verify the details, but was informed that no such account existed.

The department also contacted the Income Tax Department to verify the details of the PAN card given by the accused.

When the inspector visited the address linked to the PAN card given, it was found that no one by the name of the accused lived or worked there.

261,"GST, service tax fraud may cross ?300 crore","Mumbai: The Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (DGGSTI) is estimating the latest alleged service tax and goods and services (GST) fraud in city to cross over ?300 crore, making it one of the biggest evasion cases in recent history.

Sources said the intelligence agency has decided to contest the bail application of the director of Horizon Outsource Solutions Private Limited, Amit Upadhyaya, and Asad Anwar Sayed of Best Computer Solutions Private Limited, who jointly carried out the ?173-crore alleged service tax and GST evasion based on forged invoices of as many as 10 services related to outsourcing and information technology which were never provided in the first place.

Horizon was working in the field of manpower outsourcing and accounting. “Once the investigations are complete, we expect the total evasion to reach ?300 crore and more. We don’t expect them to go scot-free since it is a one-of-its kind case. The invoices were not only generated on services never provided but they were even printed,” sources in the DGGSTI said.

Both Upadhyaya and Sayed were arrested last week under Sections 89 and 69 of theCGST Act, 2017. The two have been remanded to judicial custody till June 2 and charged with offences under Section 132 (1) -- supply of goods or services without issue of invoices; issue invoice without supply of goods; avail of input tax using bogus invoice; collection of tax but failure to pay the government beyond three months from the date on which such payment becomes due.

According to officials, between April 1, 2016 and June 2017, Horizon took GST credit of ?79.38 crore on the basis of fake invoices from Best Computer Solutions, which was publishing and printing the invoices internally. Horizon also collected service tax of Rs. 46 crore, while issuing bogus invoices to show GST of ?47 crore towards his clients. The total fraud amount to ?173 crore, officials said.

Sources said the fraud was made possible since the new regime is still not integratedfully with an invoice matching mechanism.

263,GST fraud case: SC says bail to accused only after probe,"The Supreme Court on Thursday did not grant immediate bail to GST fraud case accused Sandeep Goyal even as it directed the investigation into the case to be completed in three months.

264,GST fraud: Of 20 fake companies and one computer that generated fake bills,"The detection of one of the biggest frauds — the generation of fake bills worth ?1,200 crore — after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime was implemented last July came after a detailed investigation spread over two months into a web of fake companies.

The accused — Suhail, Mohammed Basha and Hafeezur — had obtained GST registrations for fake companies that were shown to be engaged in trading of iron and steel scrap to other companies. They exploited the loophole of the system not being able to match GSTR-1 and GSTR-3. “The system is currently unable to match the returns. This loophole is being plugged now,” a source said.

Though the companies floated were here, the input tax credit may have been used by iron and steel producers located outside the State too, said investigators, who used data analytics to zero in on them. GST officials also believe that such fraudulent transactions are being seen in plastic, aluminium, iron and steel trade.

While Baha had obtained 14 GST registrations in the names of his relatives and others, Suhail had obtained six. They floated fake companies by giving made-up addresses, which made the investigation difficult.

“It took us two months of meticulous investigation to unearth the module and arrest the three kingpins,” said G. Narayanaswamy, Commissioner (Bengaluru South) of Central Tax. “The accused, though they had 20 companies registered, were operating on a single computer to generate all the bills. They were detected using the IP address,” he said.

Their modus operandi, according to him, was creating fake addresses, issuing fake GST invoices, and generating e-way bills with fake/wrong vehicle registration details without actually supplying any goods.

“The companies were floated with the intention to fraudulently pass on input tax credit. So far, we have found generation of GST invoices worth around ?1,200 crore that had a GST liability of about ?200 crore. We are expecting [the amount] to go up as we investigate further. There could be more such modules,” Mr. Narayanaswamy said.

The modus operandi of these individuals and their associates Sabban Ahmed and Arif, inter alia, involved issuance of fake invoices of firms registered across Delhi NCR from a premise in Azadpur, Delhi.

Prima facie fraudulent ITC of about ?25 crore has been detected to have been passed on using invoices involving an amount of ?137 crore.

The accused and their associates were found to be operating 19 fake firms created to facilitate fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC), thus defrauding the Exchequer.

Two individuals – Asrar Akhtar and Vikas Singh —have been arrested in this matter and remanded to judicial custody for 14 days by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM), New Delhi at Patiala House Courts, an official release said.

271,Finance Ministry to block ITC for entities caught using fake invoices,"In an effort to plug revenue leaks, the Central Goods & Services Tax (CGST) administration has started blocking input tax credit (ITC) for assessees who availed credit against fake invoices, or against invoices without the receipt of goods or services, or both.

The move comes at a time when the Revenue Department has increased the collection target for January and February by ?5,000 crore each. It aims to collect ?3.55-lakh crore over the last three months of the current fiscal year.

Revenue collection

In the first nine months of FY20, the department collected over ?9.08-lakh crore, against ?8.71-lakh crore during the corresponding period last fiscal. Though there was an increase it did not meet the average monthly collection expectation of ?1.10 lakh crore.

Now, in effort to boost revenue, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), under the Finance Ministry, has dispatched a letter to all the 26 field formations urging them to make a list of entities that availed fake credit and block ITC for those located in their respective jurisdictions.

If the formations have data on such entities located outside their jurisdictions, they have been asked to forward a list of those, along with their GSTN particulars, to the concerned field formation with a request to block the input tax credit immediately, the letter added.

In line with this, the lists were prepared by last Friday. Data is being collected from all the zones to assess how much credit has been blocked and how it will impact revenue collection.

Review meeting

The issue of fake invoices figured in the review meeting held on Friday. It was decided that GST authorities would look into issues such as mismatch of supply and purchase invoices, data analytics of mismatch in GSTR-1, GSTR-2A and GSTR-3B, failure of filing returns, over-invoicing, recuperation of fake or excess refunds availed beyond the permissible limits, patching tax leakages, action on checking fake or huge ITC claims, and a data analytical review of all refunds under the inverted duty structure.

SMSes and emails will be sent to fraudulent or excess ITC claimants, targeted defaulters, non-filers and those who provide mismatched information in their returns or over-invoice, or who have been identified through data analytics as having evaded tax by ‘duping’ the system.

Taxpayers who have taken ITC wrongfully can voluntarily repay the amount equal to the inadmissible credit before punitive action is taken against them following verification.

According to data collected by the DGGI, 148 cases of GST evasion were booked from July 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018, and over ?750 crore was recovered.

In FY19, the number of such cases rose to 1,473, with recovery amounting to nearly ?20,000 crore. Till October this fiscal year, nearly 1,000 cases had been booked with over ?8,000 crore recovered.",info,"In an effort to plug revenue leaks, the Central Goods & Services Tax (CGST) administration has started blocking input tax credit (ITC) for assessees who availed credit against fake invoices, or against invoices without the receipt of goods or services, or both.

272,GST: Input tax credit frauds rise 170% in just nine months of FY20,"The number of input tax credit (ITC) fraud cases under Goods & Services Tax (GST) in the first nine months of this financial year has risen 170 per cent more than that reported in the whole of last fiscal. During the same period, the amount involved is nearly 80 per cent of full FY19.

According to a Parliamentary Committee report, tabled on Thursday, the number of ITC fraud cases, based on fake invoices during April-December of this fiscal, surged to 5,986. This number was 2,211 in the 12 months of 2018-19. In terms of amount involved, the first nine months of this fiscal recorded over ?13,000 crore while recovery was nearly ?550 crore. During 2018-19, the total quantum was nearly ?10,400 crore, while recovery was a little over ?800 crore.

GST cases booked

During the first 10 months (April-January) of the current fiscal, the number of cases was 8,335 with nearly ?30,000 crore involved and the total recovery was nearly ?15,000 crore. During fiscal 2018-19, the number of cases booked was over 7,300, amount involved about ?38,000 crore and recovery nearly ?19,000 crore.

The Committee noted that system-based analytical tools and intelligence of the Directorate General of Analytics and Risk Management are being used to curb evasion in GST. It is to be noted that intensive anti-evasion efforts are being taken, particularly with respect to ITC frauds based on fake invoices.

However, the Committee observed that the monthly revenue collections from the GST are yet to stabilise. States have been reporting losses in collection, which will only increase the compensation burden of the Centre. During the current fiscal, the total target for collection of GST compensation cess is a little over ?1.09-lakh crore, while the net collection during April-December was over ?70,000 crore. However, GST compensation, released as per budget provision, and the actual requirement of States for the April-September period has exceeded ?81,000 crore.

Resolution of grievances

To keep the States in sound financial health, the Committee has called for resolution of grievances by the GST Council. The panel expects the Centre to sort out the festering issues pertaining to GST at the earliest. The Committee would also urge the Finance Ministry to extend the due date for filing GST returns to 25th of every month.

Now, all eyes are on the next GST Council meeting scheduled for March 14. States are likely to raise the issue of compensation cess and discuss ways to resolve issues related to the inverted duty structure (when indirect taxes on raw material are higher while on finished products lower), which results in outflow as refund. The estimated refund on account of the inverted rate structure is about ?20,000 crore a year.",info,"The number of input tax credit (ITC) fraud cases under Goods & Services Tax (GST) in the first nine months of this financial year has risen 170 per cent more than that reported in the whole of last fiscal.

273,"GST system vulnerable to fraudulent input tax credit claims, says CAG","The Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) has came down heavily on the GST (Goods & Services Tax) executioners saying that system is vulnerable to fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC claims).

This also substantiates the government’s response that Central GST Authorities booked cases of fake invoice(s) involving fraudulent ITC in GST. A total of 1,620 such cases involving an amount of ?11,251 crore were detected in 2018-19. Even during current fiscal (between April 1 and June 25), 535 cases came in light involving total amount of over ?2,500 crore. Authorities arrested 154 and 40 people during these two years, respectively.

According to report laid in the Lok Sabha, CAG said that law prescribes the recipient of supplies would take credit of the input tax paid on such supplies. Recipient should utilise the ITC available in the credit ledger for discharging his tax liabilities. As per GST Rules, ITC could not be claimed by a taxpayer unless it had been paid by the supplier. This was supposed to be ensured through the provisions for matching of invoices of ‘suppliers and recipients’ through filing of returns GSTR-1 and 2 and generation of monthly return GSTR-3 based on GSTR-1 and -2 filed by taxpayers, with taxpayer adding details of tax paid in GSTR-3.

However, for the time being, filing of GSTR-2 return had been kept in abeyance and taxpayers were allowed to claim ITC in GSTR-3B return without any such cross-verification. Under GSTR-3B, ITC was claimed by the taxpayer on self-assessment basis. Hence, in the absence of evidence that ITC was being claimed by a taxpayer after payment of tax by the supplier, there was a risk that the irregular ITC claims by the taxpayers might go undetected.

Excess IGST credit

According to the report, out of ?8.19 lakh crore of ITC of IGST claimed during July 1, 2017 to August 8, 2018), taxpayers of Andhra Pradesh alone claimed (on July 19, 2018) IGST-ITC for ?6.45 lakh crore which was considered as highly unlikely. This was brought to the notice of GSTN (GST Network, the IT backbone of indirect tax system) by audit on August 21, 2018.

The report noted reply by GSTN. The reply said that while filing the GSTR-3B in July for June 2018, a taxpayer in Andhra Pradesh claimed excess IGST credit of ?6.45 lakh crore. He revised the same on August 28, 2018. Thus, “unrealistic erroneous claim of ITC of IGST by one taxpayer, representing 79 per cent of total ITC claim by all taxpayers for a month, was allowed by the system, exposing the vulnerability of the system to fraudulent ITC claims,” CAG said.

It further added that the adherence to the business rules and the system design are the responsibility of Department of Revenue, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Custom (CBIC) State Tax authorities and GSTN. It mentioned that the system of payment and settlement of tax that was envisaged for GST was based on one hundred per cent invoice-matching and availment of ITC, as well as settlement of IGST on the basis of invoice-matching.

“Neither is possible as of now, as an invoice-matching system has not kicked-in. Invoice-matching is the critical requirement that would yield the full benefits of this major tax reform,” the CAG said while emphasising that it would protect the tax revenues of both the Centre and the States, it would lead to proper settlement of IGST and would minimise, if not eliminate, the tax official-assessee interface.",info,"The Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) has came down heavily on the GST (Goods & Services Tax) executioners saying that system is vulnerable to fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC claims).

Staff Reporter :

RAIPUR,

IN A major expose, the Directorate General of Goods & Service Tax Intelligence (DGGI), Raipur Zonal Unit (RZU) busted a network of GST fraud involving fictitious transactions of steel goods by way of issuance of fake invoices generated by trading firms that existed only on paper. Promoter of the fake firm has been arrested and remanded to judicial custody. Investigation revealed that it was one of the biggest GST fraud cases in Central India in 2020.

The non-existent eight firms had purportedly transacted steel goods between them to the tune of Rs 400 crore involving GST of Rs 60 crore during the period from March 2018 to October 2019. The unearthing of racket was based on precise intelligence inputs, acting upon on which the DGGI undertook surveillance at several places across five states including Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

“The intelligence was successful in tracking and locating Prakash Bihari Lal Dadhichi, the promoter and one of the Directors of M/s. Dadhichi Iron and Steel Pvt. Ltd, Rajgangpur, Distt. Sundargarh, Odisha who had actually created a chain of eight fictitious trading firms at different places in different states. “Dadhichi had orchestrated the entire racket and managed to obtain registrations for such firms with the respective jurisdictional GST Department where the proprietors were either his close relatives, including female members of the family, friends, and staff including his erstwhile driver,” Nem Singh, Joint Director, DGGI, told ‘The Hitavada’. According to Singh, the DGGI sleuths conducted massive raid and search operations at 20 declared business premises, residential premises and other crucial locations in five States, which involved the participation of more than 100 officers including those from the jurisdictional CGST Commissionerates and other units of the DGGI.

“The entire operation was steered by Ajay Kumar Pandey (IRS) Additional Director General of the Raipur Unit of DGGI and were led under the guidance of Tikendra Kripal, Deputy Director, Sheeti Kantha Das, Assistant Director and Shivi Sangwan, Assistant Director,” he added.

276,"Central, state governments to step up GST refunds scrutiny to curb fake claims","Central, state governments to step up GST refunds scrutiny to curb fake claims

This comes at a time when the government has been witnessing continued shortfall in GST revenue collections.

Money GST

The Central and state governments will henceforth become strict with those in the industry and trade claiming refunds under the new GST regime on false premises. In a meeting called by the Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, officials from the states and centre jointly decided to devise the means to detect such fraudulent refund claims, as per a Livemint report.

The statement put out by the government said the measure will look to curb inverted tax structure refund claims and wanton evasion of GST.

The mechanism will involve compulsorily investigating all fake claims and institute better coordination amongst agencies like the income tax department and GST authorities.

It has been explained that the governments are worried that there is a decline in the revenue month on month while the unscrupulous elements in the trade are taking undue advantage of the loopholes in the system and depriving the government of GST collections.

Lower GST collections have meant the centre is left with insufficient funds to transfer to the states, as per the understanding, to compensate for the losses with the introduction of GST. In an indirect way, the states too have a vested interest in seeing that the GST collections are boosted, and leaks plugged. The setting up of a joint mechanism therefore becomes easier.

The government will also take a serious look at how data can be shared among the GST Council, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the revenue department and other relevant agencies within the government. This kind of sharing of information is lacking in the present arrangement and businesses take advantage of such loopholes.

For instance, companies put up fraudulent refund claims on GST paid on raw materials which they say they have exported. The government will now investigate if such claims are true by verifying the foreign exchange remittances received in the assessee’s account. Going a step further, the government may insist on the exporter channelling the foreign remittance and the GST refunds into the same bank account. This will also give a semblance of control over the flow of funds and make it easier to detect fraudulent claims.

One may therefore see a series of steps being announced by the governments to implement the decisions taken at the joint meeting. This may happen within this month itself.",info,"Central, state governments to step up GST refunds scrutiny to curb fake claimsThis comes at a time when the government has been witnessing continued shortfall in GST revenue collections.

The traders had suppressed the amount of product that was being traded, in order to evade GST, officials said.

news Crime

The Karnataka commercial tax department found undeclared arecanut valued at Rs 11 crore from godowns raided at Shivamogga and Sagara in the state's Malenadu region, an official said on Friday.

""Godowns and premises of arecanut merchants were raided at Shivamogga and Sagara towns. This was based on a tip-off that a huge quantity of arecanut was purchased and stored by traders without documents during the COVID-19 induced lockdown in the state,"" the tax official said in a statement. The department collected Rs 1.10 crore as Goods and Services Tax (GST) with penalty from the merchants on the unspecified quantity of arecanut.

Shivamogga is about 300 km northwest of Bengaluru in the southern state of Karnataka, while Sagara is about 70 km away from Shivamogga.

The South Zone Enforcement Additional Commissioner Nitesh Patil led the raiding team in nine places at Shivamogga and four places at Sagara on Tuesday after keeping a close watch on the premises and movement of the goods.

""Inspection of books revealed unaccounted-for transactions and a suppressed turnover which quantified so far was worth Rs 11 crore,"" according to the statement.

Large quantities of arecanut are grown in Shivamogga, Chitradurga and Davanagere districts and sold to traders in northern states for use as an ingredient in paan (betel nut) and making ‘supari' or ‘ghutka'.

As the transactions were off the books, the information will be shared with the APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) yard in the district so that they take action against the merchants.

""Preliminary investigation also showed some merchants obtained tax invoices from fictitious traders in Tamil Nadu to claim fake input tax credit,"" added the official.

The Hindu reported that the tax department is said to be on the lookout for similar GST violations during the lockdown. Other sectors are also under the scanner.",other,"Illegal arecanut worth Rs 11 crore seized in KarnatakaThe traders had suppressed the amount of product that was being traded, in order to evade GST, officials said.

279,"GST fraud: 1,200 exporters seeking Rs 350 crore GST refund untraceable","Representational image

New Delhi: Even after two years of implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the government is struggling to plug leakages in the system. A probe by the GST authorities has revealed that nearly 1,200 exporters, who made GST refund claims of Rs 350 crore, were untraceable, the Times of India reported.

Citing sources, the daily said that over 800 entities have been prevented from exporting overvalued merchandise of Rs 1,500 crore to claim fake IGST with refunds over the last five months.

GST authorities also suspect the involvement of few custom brokers in these frauds, involving fictitious entities, existing only in virtual space, through identity thefts with fake and morphed documents. The role of 50-odd brokers is under the scanner as they were found to have dealt with exporters who are now untraceable. As part of the licensing conditions, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has allowed these brokers to independently verify the KYC of exporters, the publication mentioned.

Initial scrutiny of the Integrated GST claims had revealed that eight star trading houses, which are entitled to several benefits, were also not traceable, prompting the revenue department to keep close tabs on these entities. Tax officials said that the entire exercise has been undertaken through the analysis of data, which is also shared with other government agencies including CBDT.

The publication citing sources said, newer modus operandi are now surfacing. An investigation related to a Delhi-based company revealed fraudulent refund claim of close to Rs 10 crore. The firm was ostensibly exporting readymade garments to a special economic zone. The taxpayer was selected for physical scrutiny and found non-existent at his declared address. It was also found that the owners of the firm were dummy persons.

Using a web of fake invoicing of over Rs 847 crore, the company is accused of creating a fraudulent tax credit of Rs 195 crore. Investigations showed that even the suppliers were untraceable.

280,"Rs 40,000 crore GST claims on hold amid alleged fraud by entities","Representational image

New Delhi: The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has frozen tax credits of entities to the tune of Rs 40,000 crore as GST returns did not match, exposing alleged fraud by close to 2,000 entities. The above amount also includes entities that have not filed returns.

According to a report in the Times of India, the indirect tax wing of the revenue department, last week, blocked the credits within four hours, CBIC chairman John Joseph said at an event on Monday.

According to GST rules, companies are entitled to credits on tax paid on inputs in the production chain so that there is no cascading effect of taxes. But major discrepancies in returns and instances of a large number of frauds prompted the government to crack the whip.

Frauds have taken place in multiple ways. The publication citing sources said the department had collected data on mismatch of over 20% in the initial GSTR-1 filing for the month and the final GSTR-3B returns. Subsequently, the bar was lowered to a difference of 10% and the government used various red flags to then identify companies, while completely relying on data instead of sending tax inspectors to premises to check for books.

The standard operating procedure developed by the revenue department is to share the data with the state governments, which then move in, first asking them to make the corrections or pay up.

But the scrutiny of the data has revealed that several fly-by-night operators were misusing the benefit. There were entities which were set up just for the sake of showing bogus turnover and relied on a web of shell companies. These companies, many of which used forged documents, then vanished from the scene, prompting the government to tighten norms for GST registration.

“In many cases it has been found that traders purchased iron and steel scrap but raised GST bills for garments to exporters, who in turn claimed refund of IGST (integrated GST) paid on export,” the daily quoted a tax lawyer as saying.

Tribune News Service

Panipat, June 8

As many as 400 big and small firms in Panipat have allegedly used fake bills amounting to Rs 800 crore to evade tax. During the investigation, it has been found that the firms in question have registered 19 bogus firms, including 17 in Panipat and two in Uttar Pradesh, to facilitate the tax evasion. The Superintendent of Police (SP) Sumit Kumar has constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to inquire the matter in detail.

The CIA-2 unit on Tuesday arrested three persons — Rajesh Mittal, Inder Pratap Singh and Manish Kumar — for their alleged involvement in the bogus billing scam. The police also arrested their aide and lawyer, Satnarayan Rohilla. Along with the State Excise and Taxation Department officials, the police are interrogating the accused.

During the investigation, the accused reportedly admitted to have been involved in the tax evasion scam since 2017. They also revealed that 19 bogus firms have been registered on the GST portal of which 17 are shown in Panipat and two in Lucknow.

“No industry or firm was found on the address shown by owners of firms during verification. We have recovered 63 files from Rohilla’s office and the number of bogus firms can rise,” said SP Sumit Kumar, adding that the SIT, led by Panipat DSP Bijender Singh, has been constituted to investigate the matter thoroughly.

Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioner (Sales) and Deputy Commissioner, State Tax (GST), Raja Ram Nain said the department’s teams are scrutinising the files to calculate the total tax evasion by the accused. He added that the accused reportedly issued bogus bills of around Rs 800 crore and evaded tax of around Rs 60-70 crore of which Rs 20 crore is through bogus firms, he said.

The department would soon summon all those businessmen who had used these bogus bills, Nain said.

282,Multi-crore GST fraud detected in Ambala,"Nitin Jain

Tribune News Service

Ambala, November 21

In what could be the tip of the iceberg, five Ambala traders were today booked by the district police for committing a fraud by registering fake firms with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) portal and causing a loss of almost Rs 6 crore to the state exchequer, the Excise and Taxation department confirmed.

The fraudsters have been identified as Tejinder Singh, who floated Tejinder Enterprises, Ravinder Singh of Super Impax, Harish of Ambala Steel Corporation, Jai Parkash of Haryana Steel and Anshu Jathol of AS Alloys.

All these fake firms were shown registered at various locations in Ambala City but during physical verification, none of them were found to be existing, Excise and Taxation officials told The Tribune here today.

Reporting the matter to the police, Excise and Taxation Officer (ETO) Dhanpati Bhardwaj said that the accused had floated fake firms and registered those in Ambala City with the help of fake documents to do trading of over Rs 45 crore and claiming almost Rs 6 crore input tax credit in connivance with other traders of Haryana and neighbouring states within a period ranging between three months to six months.

Acting on a complaint of the ETO addressed to Ambala Superintendent of Police (SP) Abhishek Jorwal, the district police booked the multi-crore GST scam accused for cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the IPC and launched a manhunt for them.

“We have registered five separate cases and initiated further investigations to nail all those who caused loss to the state exchequer by way of cheating and forgery,” a senior police officer said. The police were also on the lookout for other traders in Haryana and neighbouring states besides the department officials, if any, who connived with the main accused to execute the multi-crore fraud.

The police did not rule out the involvement of some department officials in the scam. “We are probing all the angles and will go to the bottom of it by nailing all those involved,” the officer added.

In his complaint to the police, the ETO said the accused traders got their firms registered in Ambala City between December last and September this year. Upon verification, it was found that no such firms existed on the spot.

“We went to check the authenticity of the firm and found that the rent deeds and mobile phone number on the basis of which the firms were registered were fake. No such addresses or firms existed on the ground and the mobile phone numbers given in the registration forms were also incorrect,” the department told the police.

He further informed that upon checking the transactions done by the firms through the GST portal, it was found that the said firms did trading and issued sale bills and e-way bills amounting to over Rs 45.18 crore to the traders within and outside Haryana and paid no tax.

“In the process, the fake firms extended benefit of over Rs 5.92 crore input tax credit to the traders who purchased goods from them whereas there was neither any input tax credit in the name of said firms nor it had paid any tax,” revealed the ETO, while pegging the loss of over Rs 5.92 crore to the state exchequer during the initial investigations.

“We suspect that the said traders in connivance with other traders might have floated other such fake firms in other parts of Haryana and outside as well to cause more loss to the state exchequer,” said senior department officials, while hoping that the arrest of the kingpin would unearth the entire nexus behind the multi-crore racket.

283,GST fraud a blot on Panipat,"Mukesh Tandon

Panipat is globally popular for its handloom business but it is getting infamy due to Goods and Services Tax (GST) scams. According to the Central Excise and Taxation Department and the state excise and taxation department, bogus billing has touched Rs 2,000 crore in Panipat alone. Around 65 cases of GST frauds, 26 of them in Panipat, have been registered across the state. As many as 45 non-existing firms have been identified by the CGST and SGST authorities in the last six months.

As many as 34,000 firms have been registered under the GST — 20,000 firms with the state Excise and Taxation Department and 14,000 with the Central GST Department. The fact is that the delay in the verification of firms is giving rise to GST frauds.

The teams of the Central GST Department from Panchkula unearthed a scam of fake bills amounting to Rs 450 crore on January 4 and found false input tax claim of Rs 30 crore.

Just after a day, the teams of the State Excise and Taxation Department identified 21 non-existent firms, which had claimed input tax credit of Rs 49 crore through bogus sale of Rs 470 crore.

Just after two months, the State Excise and Taxation Department unearthed a bogus billing scam of Rs 147 crore committed by two firms in Panipat city on March 9. They had claimed tax credit of Rs 13.78 crore. Besides, the department also identified two more firms that had allegedly issued bogus bills to the tune of Rs 89.3 crore on March 10 without the movement of goods.

The CIA-2 team arrested Rajesh Mittal, Inder Pratap Singh, and Manish Kumar on June 4 and their associate Satnarayan Rohilla on June 6. During investigation, it was revealed that they had issued bogus bills amounting to Rs 800 crore to around 400 firms. The team identified 19 non-existing firms registered on the GST portal, out of which 17 were registered at Panipat and two at Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh.

Vinod Khandelwal, president, Haryana Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Panipat Chapter, says, “It is unfortunate that Panipat is getting a bad name due to GST frauds but this cannot be possible without the connivance of government officials, as the GST is handled electronically”.

Ajay Singla, an RTI activist, says that it is sad that Panipat is becoming infamous due to GST scams while in reality the bogus billing scandal flourishing in connivance with government officials is spread throughout the state.

Fake bill scams or GST frauds are happening due to the lethargic attitude of Taxation Department officials, as they are not keen to verify the particulars of a firm after its registration under the GST or physically verify it. Also, there is no check on bank transactions of these firms, he adds.

People involved in bogus billing should be checked at the beginning but officials never do it, says Singla. “I have collected huge information under the RTI Act in which cotton, cement, iron rod and other FMCG goods, Singla says. The firms registered under the GST to commit frauds are closed by fraudsters after some time,” he adds.

Vidya Sagar, Additional Excise and Taxation Commissioner (Enforcement), says, “Our department is dealing strictly with persons involved in bogus billing. We have registered cases against persons involved in bogus billing scams across the state and are also recovering tax credit claimed by firm owners through bogus bills”.

Vidya Sagar says, “It is very easy to get a GST number. If a person applies for a GSTN, he will get it within 72 hours. Only the PAN Card is mandatory for registration because after its verification the system does not verify any document uploaded on the portal and people get the benefit of the technology lacuna”.

Raja Ram Nain, Assistant Commissioner, Excise and Taxation Department, says, “The total GST fraud by firms in Panipat through bogus bills is around Rs 13.5 crore and out of it Rs 12.5 crore has been recovered. Most of the non-existing firms found involved in bogus billing scams were registered under the Central GST”. “Officials cannot verify the details of firms at an early stage because the information reaches the department after around 50 days,” he adds.",fake firms,"According to the Central Excise and Taxation Department and the state excise and taxation department, bogus billing has touched Rs 2,000 crore in Panipat alone.

285,"GST evasion, refund fraud crackdown: Several steps to curb scams proposed","With the narrative shifting from rate increase to tightening the GST system for augmenting revenue, the government has finalised a slew of measures to curb evasion including investigation of major fraud cases by the Income Tax department (I-T) and frequent data sharing by various agencies.

In a meeting chaired by Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, a panel comprising Central and state GST officers has been proposed to be set up to examine and implement quick measures in a given time frame to curb fraudulent refund claims, including the inverted tax structure refund claims and evasion of GST.

The Committee will come out with detailed procedures which will be implemented across the country by January-end. Considering fraudulent IGST refund claims, the option of linking foreign exchange remittances with IGST refund for risky and new exporters was explored. All major cases of fake Input Tax Credit, export/import fraud and fraudulent refunds shall also be compulsorily investigated by the investigation wing of the Income Tax Department.

Further, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) would be signed among the CBDT, the CBIC and the GSTN to exchange data through API, from the CBDT to the GSTN and the CBIC and vice versa. It was decided that this data should be shared on a quarterly basis, instead of being shared on yearly basis.

Tax experts said that strengthening tax administration is way forward. Data collected by various agencies are going to be the key to identify possible fraud in its early phase.""One of the key benefits of GST is data which could be sliced and diced for ascertaining possible fraud or evasion. If GST compliance would go up, the compliance of income tax would also go up,"" a tax expert said.

According to officials, they also explored ways to make the GST system aligned with Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the purpose of getting bank account details and transactions and also PAN based banking transactions.

The fraud pertained to the issuance of fake GST invoices to 63 taxpayers without delivery of any goods or service, PTI reported.

In November 2018, the Trade and Taxes department of the Delhi government had detected a fraud of Rs 22.74 crore committed by a businessman. He allegedly used forged documents to claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) under the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

Representative image

CHENNAI: The GST intelligence unit in Chennai on Monday arrested three people involved in an input tax credit fraud to the extent of Rs 900 crore, officials said.

“Searches conducted between December 19 and 20 at several premises in and around Chennai unearthed a GST fraud involving Rs 900 crore. The firms were creating identity documents from gullible people and GST registrations were obtained for issuing invoices and fraudulent input tax credit,” said principal additional director general DGGI, K Anpazhagan on Monday.

Based on information, the intelligence unit found out the mastermind for the entire fraudulent network. “Along with two other accomplices, the mastermind was involved in creating numerous bogus firms and opening of bank accounts based on PAN and Aadhaar cards obtained from identity lenders. They were promised bank loans,” said Anpazhagan.

The unit seized cash to the extent of Rs 24 lakh from the residence of the kingpin. The intelligence unit refused to name the mastermind or his accomplices. The unit found that the seized amount was the commission that the mastermind earned.

“During searches of one of the mastermind’s accomplices, we seized hundreds of PAN and Aadhaar cards said to have been collected from gullible lenders, mostly women, in rural areas of Tindivanam and Villupuram districts,” the official said.

The documents from these women were used for floating bogus firms to expand the network of their activities. “Apart from PAN and Aadhaar cards, photos, cheque leaves with signatures, debit and credit cards and rubber stamps of various bogus firms were also seized,” he said.

291,"GST fraud: Star exporter paid tax Rs 1,650, took refund of Rs 3.9 crore","The department based the advice on preliminary findings that some ‘Star’ exporters were fraudulently availing IGST refunds.

The revenue department has asked the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to make the system of accrediting exporters with ‘Star’ tag more robust since such exporters enjoy many facilities, including reduced customs inspections. The department based the advice on preliminary findings that some ‘Star’ exporters were fraudulently availing IGST refunds.

“There are instances where an exporter with over Rs 50 crore of exports of readymade garments has taken refund of Rs 3.9 crore while the entity’s total GST payment in cash was a mere Rs1,650. In another case, tax payments in cash were Rs51,201 while the exporter obtained refund of Rs9.59 crore.

It is believed that such cases involve fake invoicing and fraudulent tax credits, which have been encashed through the facility of IGST refunds,” another official said. It further said there was a strong case for DGFT to continuously (or annually) seek a compliance and verification report from other regulators or obligate the exporters to produce statutory records of compliance, including certifications from the banks of “No NPAs”.

FE had reported last week that the revenue department had red-flagged nearly 250 ‘star’ exporters after its data analytics system found them to be ‘risky’ – which means that they could be availing higher refunds than their legal entitlement through fake invoices. The refund for these exporters has been blocked pending verification.

Star Export House exporters are certified by the government on the basis of export performance (Rs15 crore to Rs5,000 crore FOB in the current and three preceding years). They are extended certain benefits including customs clearance on self-certification basis and exemption from furnishing bank guarantee under certain schemes.

“Of the 241 cases taken up for detailed scrutiny, data of 82 star exporters show that declarations before income tax and GST are at significant variance. Data matching between income tax and GST of the star exporters has also shown that 40 out of 241 entities have declared turnover from business ranging from NIL to less than Rs1 crore in FY17-18 and FY18-19, whereas it is understood that an exporter must maintain exports of $3 million in a year to be eligible for the status,” the department said in a letter to DGFT.

Official sources said the indirect tax department (CBIC) has extensively used data analytics using information furnished by the taxpayers to income tax, GST and customs department to identify risky exporters. Ongoing investigations have thrown up at least 9 star export houses as‘non-traceable’ at their premises declared on record.

He started floating many of the shell companies in 2012. Some of these firms were floated after the GST came into force. These shell companies, according to officials, were also engaged in trading with at least 15 other genuine businesses, which are also now under the scanner. “Establishing trading with these genuine firms will take some time as many of these companies are not within our jurisdiction,” said the source.For the past one year, Anti-Evasion departments of commissionerates across the country have become more vigilant about cases involving fraudulent use of input tax credit.

This made us suspicious and we decided to visit some of the firms owned by Shah,” the officer said. During site inspection, it was found that most of them existed only on paper and didn’t have any physical offices.The officer also said that investigators analysed the data pertaining to E-way bills available on the portal of Good and Services Tax Network, the IT backbone of GST. “It was found that most of the vehicles whose registration numbers were provided as those used for carrying the supplies traded were motorcycles, cars and tankers.

296,5 firm owners booked for Rs 19-cr GST fraud,"Tribune News Service

Hisar, March 7

After detecting tax evasion and taking the input tax credit, the state Excise and Taxation Department has identified five shell firms that perpetrated the fraud under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) by cheating the department of Rs18.97 crore in Hisar district.

A spokesperson for the department said the police had registered five criminal cases against the traders who floated shell firms to deal in cotton. These traders forged the documents by preparing fake invoices and receipts which were used in claiming the ITC from the government under the GST norms.

Those who have been booked are Praveen Mehta, proprietor of M/s Krishan Cotton Industries, Hisar; Ankush of M/s Ankush Cotton & Ginning, Durjanpur village; Kamal Kumar, Sanjay Kumar and Manoj Kumar (all brothers), residents of Fransi village, Sonu of M/s Vishal Industries, Adampur and Vakil Chand of M/s Aggarwal Cotton Industries, Adampur.

They had been booked under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (fraud), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged documents or electronic records as genuine) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.

In his complaint, Excise and Taxation Officer Mahavir Godara said during the site verification of these firms at the given addresses, no such establishments found existing.

The scam has taken serious proportions with Central GST teams, too, conducting raids at the offices of several cotton traders in Hisar, Sirsa and Fatehabad in Haryana, besides Punjab and Gujarat.

298,"Official accused of Rs 50 crore GST fraud, denied bail","This story is from June 10, 2018

(Representative image)

GURUGRAM: An excise and taxation department employee accused of a Rs 50-crore GST fraud has been denied bail by the district and sessions court. Gourav Behl, an assistant in the excise and taxation department, was arrested on April 12 by a special investigation team of Gurugram police. He is currently lodged in Bhondsi jail.

The main accused, Rajesh Arora, a chartered accountant, allegedly used to make fake bills in the name of ‘Uma Shankar Traders’ and ‘Vipin Enterprises’ and submit them to seek input credit of around Rs 52 crore. Input credit is a provision that allows a business to claim back the taxes paid for purchase of certain goods and services. Arora is also in judicial custody.

Behl, 32, sought bail on the ground that he had been made a scapegoat in the case. “Being a junior employee in the department, he had no role in the matter. He is in jail for a long time and is not required for further investigation,” his counsel Shyambir Singh told the court during bail plea hearing on June 6.

However, public prosecutor Anurag Hooda opposed the bail plea, saying that “four criminal cases are registered against Behl related to GST fraud”. “Behl is the main conduit and his release would hamper the investigation. During investigation, it has come to light that it was Behl who had helped the main accused by destroying the files of the two firms,” he argued.

Observing that tax fraud has caused huge loss to the exchequer and a thorough investigation is required, district and sessions judge Ravi Kumar Sondhi said, “Granting bail to accused, who is an employee of the department, will hamper the probe, especially when some more heads are yet to roll and records to be examined and recovered.”

“Keeping in view of the gravity of the offence and its repercussions on the society at large and state exchequer in particular and the sensitive stage of investigation, there is no ground to release the applicant (Behl) on bail,” the court observed in its order.

According to police, the scam was unearthed in Chandigarh when some excise and taxation officers found that Vipin Enterprises did not exist at all. However, Uma Shankar Traders is operating in Sector 29, but the owner of the company had no information about the bills.

The accused made the fake company in 2015 and had been involved in the fraud since their arrests.

Uma Shankar Traders deals in plastic items and cigarettes. Investigations revealed that the accused sought input credit of Rs 2 crore in the name of Uma Shankar Traders and Rs 49 crore in the name of Vipin Enterprises.

299,GST officials detect tax fraud of Rs 224 crore by eight companies,"Officials of the Central GST have unearthed an alleged tax fraud of Rs 224 crore by a group of eight companies, which generated fake invoices worth Rs 1,289 crore.

A key suspect involved in the racket has been arrested and Rs 19.75 crore was recovered from him, a press release from the Hyderabad Central GST Commissionerate said Tuesday night.

Several documents were recovered during the simultaneous searches on Tuesday night at the residential and business premises of these companies, which are involved in the trade of iron and steel products.

The companies have been generating fake invoices without actual supply of TMT bars, MS bars, MS flat products among others, and were passing on the input tax credit to other tax payers within the same group, besides some other taxpayers since July, 2017, it said.

The fake invoices generated by them involved about Rs 1,289 crore of value and input tax credit of about Rs 224 crore.

""Five out of these taxpayers are operating from the same address and many of the Directors/Partners/Proprietors of these firms/companies,are common,"" the release said.

These companies were also found to be indulging in circular fake trading to inflate their turnover, besides supplying such fake invoices and e-way bills to some others, the GST officials said.

""Investigation also, prima facie, reveals that the above modus operandi is also being adopted to defraud the Banks for claiming ineligible credit facilities or Letters of Credit (LCs), without any collateral securities,"" it added.

300,"Rs 127 Cr GST Fraud Unearthed In Mumbai, Two Accused Sent To 15 Days Judicial Custody","On May 19, Amit Upadhyay, 40, and Asad Anwar Sayed, 42, were sent to judicial custody for 15 days by a local court in Mumbai. Upadhyay and Sayed had allegedly conspired to give effect to a Rs 127 crore tax fraud. The Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (DGGSTI) is estimating this fraud to be over Rs 300 crore, and, reportedly, has decided to contest the bail applications of the two accused.

It seems the duo had, allegedly, duped the government by wrongfully claiming GST credit of Rs 80 crores for non-existent services. Upadhyay’s company, Horizon Outsource Solutions Private Ltd, showed fake invoices raised by Sayed’s company, Best Computer Solutions Private Ltd, and then claimed GST credit for the non-existent services received. This also resulted in artificially boosting Horizon’s turnover, Rs 400 crore for FY 2016-17, enabling Upadhyay to leverage more funding.

As per reports, it also came to light that Horizon collected Rs 47 crore service tax in the period, April 2016 – June 2017, but did not deposit the money with the government.

As reported by the Hindu, sources in DGGSTI said, “Once the investigations are complete, we expect the total evasion to reach ?300 crore and more. We don’t expect them to go scot-free since it is a one-of-its-kind case. The invoices were not only generated on services never provided, but they were even printed.”

They have been charged under section 132(1) of CGST act for supply of goods or services without issue of invoices, issue of invoice without supply of goods, availing input tax using bogus invoice, and collection of tax but failure to pay the government beyond three months from the date on which such payment becomes due.

Just in 2018, several GST fraud cases have come to light. Rs 50.34 crore fraud in Haryana, Rs 100 crore scam in Punjab, and a Rs 40 crore case in Kolkata. Reportedly, invoice matching mechanism is expected to be rolled out on July 1 which will curb the possible tax evasion on account of fake invoice frauds.",fake invoices,"On May 19, Amit Upadhyay, 40, and Asad Anwar Sayed, 42, were sent to judicial custody for 15 days by a local court in Mumbai.

302,Crime branch to probe Rs 174 crore GST fraud,"This story is from January 10, 2019

Representative image

CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government has asked its home department to let the state’s crime bureau investigate into a GST fraud in which bogus firms spread out across 10 districts availed input-tax concessions of Rs 174 crore.

The move comes even as the taxation department has decided to examine the role of officials in the fraud who were supposed to physically verify firms after their registration under the Goods and ServiceTax Act. Investigations, so far, have revealed that 44 fake companies in 10 districts of Haryana availed tax benefits of up to Rs 174 crore by showing bogus transactions of Rs 1,472 crore .

The taxation department’s officers and employees will assist investigating officers of the police, said Haryana additional chief secretary (ACS) Sanjeev Kaushal. The department has already started seizing the accounts of bogus firms identified so far, he added.

Kaushal said the transfer of cases to the crime branch would speed up investigations.

Under GST, a firm is automatically registered through the online process. All this takes three days. Though tax officers are supposed to verify the firm’s office physically, this did not happen in case of the fake companies. “We will check if this process was verified in the case of fake firms which availed the benefits. “Exemplary action will follow in case any employee or official is found to be involved in the case or is indicted,” Kaushal said.

Kaushal told TOI that the investigation was still on, and the department was likely to wind up the probe by the month end.

The scam was revealed during the physical audit of two companies. Later, Haryana Police registered cases on complaints by the excise and taxation officer of the district concerned.

Maximum number of cases were registered in Panipat, and these were followed by Hisar, Fathehabd, Rohtak, Kurukshtra and Bhiwani.

Besides registration of the cases against the companies as well as the their registered owners, the Department has decided to lodge the separate FIRs against the masterminds of this racket identified by the department so far. Sources informed that in Yamuanangar, an ex officials of Central Exisise Commissionerate was the mastermind. Similarly, in Hisar and Rohtak, the old traders who had associate with financial consultant had masterminded the racket.

303,Firms raided for dubious export incentives were found guilty by DRI official last year,"Ludhiana: In a significant development related to March 6 raids by Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), New Delhi, on several Ludhiana and Delhi-based firms for allegedly filing bogus input tax credit claims worth Rs 61 crore, it has emerged that Chander Shekhar, additional director general (ADG) of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Ludhiana, who is under suspension after he arrested in an alleged bribery case, had already conducted an investigation against a majority of these firms last year in June.

The then ADG in his report had concluded that the Delhi-based firms had availed dubious export incentives of Rs 108 crore and four exporting firms were procuring bills for the same from 12 companies owned by a Ludhiana-based businessman. He is the same businessman, whose four firms were raided by DGGI on March 6. The inquiry which was being conducted by Chander Shekhar was handed over to the headquarters in October last year. From his note, a copy of which is in possession of TOI, it is clear that the ADG had shared the information about the fraud being conducted by these firms with other agencies like DGGI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

Sources said the then ADG had sent this information via a secret note to DRI headquarters in New Delhi. In his note sent on November 18, 2019, he had also claimed that the Delhi businessman who is kingpin of this racket, (who was later in the DGGI raids of March 6) would try and malign image of DRI officers investigating the case to derail the probe.

Almost one-and-a-half months after this, Chander Shekhar was arrested by CBI on January 1 for allegedly demanding bribe from a Delhi-based businessman through two other businessmen (Ludhiana’s Rajesh Dhanda and Delhi’s Anoop Joshi), who were known to him. Though ADG was later granted bail in this case, he continues to be under suspension.

Though senior officials from the department concerned have been found tight-lipped in the matter, the turn of events and the surfacing of secrete note has set off speculations in the bureaucratic circles.

What the ‘secret’ note said

In his secret note, then ADG Chander Shekhar has said, “It was observed that these four exporting firms owned by the Delhi-based businessman had availed export incentives of Rs 108 crores and four exporting firms were procuring bills from 12 companies owned by one Ludhiana-based businessman who had in past been a COFEPOSA detainee.”

“The transaction appeared suspicious and accordingly, DRI Ludhiana had issued a letter to Punjab State GST for providing complete chain of purchase of 12 firms. State GST, Ludhiana, started submitting investigation report to DRI Ludhiana which prima facie indicated bogus purchases and supplies by companies owned by this Ludhiana businessman,” the note said.

“Punjab State GST also submitted a comprehensive 46-page final investigation report in respect of all 12 companies owned by the Ludhiana businessman to DRI, which indicated that purchase of the said 12 firms appeared to be bogus as the trail down the suppliers became nil in each of the 12 companies. The question arose that if the procurement of 12 companies of Ludhiana are bogus, as indicated by Punjab GST reports, the supplies made by them to four exporting firms based in Delhi are bogus too and therefore the nature of goods exported by these four companies needed to be investigated. The entire case appeared to be case circular trading of invoices of over Rs 2,000 crore by creating a maze of fictitious companies,” the official had written.

“It’s worthwhile to mention here that on these suspected exports, four exporting firms of Delhi businessman had availed export incentives of Rs 108 crore. The foreign remittances received to the tune of Rs 1,000 cr to Rs 1,500 crore (presuming export incentive to be in range of 7.5% to 10%) also therefore appeared to be of doubtful nature. DRI, Ludhiana transferred the investigation of 12 firms of Ludhiana businessman to DGGI HQ along with 46-page report of Punjab State GST as the subject matter of fraudulent ITC/GST was not in domain of DRI,” Chander Shekhar had added.

By Sumit Garg and Keshav Choudhary

In his keynote address at a recent media event, PM Narendra Modi highlighted concerns about the low levels of tax compliance in India. He also emphasised that the tax administration is moving from being process-centric to citizen-centric, citing direct tax reforms such as a faceless scrutiny process and lowering of tax rates. Given the government’s focus on effective tax governance, there’s a need to make a case for viewing the tax system in a holistic manner. Synergies between both the direct and indirect tax administrations can be harnessed to bring in greater simplicity, efficiency, and tax compliance.

The first area where greater synergy can be attained is cross-border trade transactions between a parent MNC and its related parties. Think of a situation where an Indian subsidiary imports goods or services from its parent entity located abroad. Both direct tax (income tax) and indirect tax (customs and GST) offices must arrive at an arms-length price of the transaction (transfer pricing) between the related parties to do their respective tax assessments. There is a conflict here. The income tax officer would look at the transaction with the suspicion that much of the price has been transferred by the Indian subsidiary to its parent MNC. If the officer is not convinced with the argument of the Indian subsidiary, she will adjust the transaction price in a manner such that more profit is attributed to the Indian subsidiary, and, therefore, adjust the price downwards. However, the customs officer, at the same time, in her best judgement and to safeguard the revenue will like to adjust the same price upwards so that the base for charging the customs duty and GST increases. In both the situations, the goal is the same, i.e, determination of the correct transaction value. Since the two departments work separately, the methodologies differ, which leads to litigation, and also enhances the cost for the business. In fact, transfer pricing orders from income tax are often produced before customs authorities to contest valuations and vice versa. Better coordination between CBDT and CBIC can go a long way in arriving at a fair valuation for such transactions, thereby giving greater tax certainty to businesses.

Further, under the convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which India has ratified, 136 countries cooperate to tackle tax evasion and avoidance. This multilateral instrument includes exchange of information on income tax matters, and is administered by the Foreign Tax division (FT&TR) of the CBDT. At the same time, countries share customs information via Customs Mutual Assistance Agreements (CMAA). However, there is a lack of an effective information sharing mechanism pertaining to VAT/GST. Incorporating provisions for exchange of information in such matters alongside existing income tax provisions can be useful in preventing GST avoidance and evasion, especially in online purchase of services such as entertainment, e-journals, etc, by Indian consumers—a rapidly growing area.

E-commerce is another area where synergies exist. Sellers on platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, etc, have benefitted from increase in market access. From the tax officer’s point of view, there is a situation now where the sellers who may not have been tax-compliant earlier now leave a trail behind when they do business through such platforms. Capturing such sales are important for both the tax departments, for widening the tax base. Under GST, e-commerce operators have been made liable to deduct 1% GST as TCS on the payments made by platforms to the sellers. The consolidated TCS statement is then to be filed on the GSTN portal in the form of a GSTR-8 return. Since capturing the true incomes of these sellers is an area of concern for the income tax authorities as well, Budget 2020 has amended the Income Tax Act and introduced a new section, 194-O, that requires e-commerce operators to deduct TDS of 1% while making payments to sellers. Here, again, there is a scope to unify the two processes at the level of the e-commerce operators. Furthermore, cross-verification of this data between the two administrations can also prevent misreporting and evasion of taxes by sellers.

The case for lowering compliance burden is the strongest for small businesses. Both the GST and the income tax law recognise this and have made provisions for small businesses. Under the GST, the composition scheme has been created to allow taxpayers having turnover of up to `1.5 crore to pay GST of 1% on the annual turnover, with no input tax credit, by filing an annual GSTR-4 return (payments are quarterly). The I-T Act provides for a similar scheme of presumptive taxation, where small taxpayers are taxed at 6% or 8% of turnover, depending on the situation. Once again, there is scope for unifying these processes to ease the burden on the taxpayer since both administrations impose a similar tax on a similar class of taxpayers.

Several other examples can be found where better coordination between CBDT and CBIC can yield more efficient outcomes. Carrying out such unification is easier said than done. Both the GST law and the Income Tax Act have their own administrative mechanisms, thresholds, and exemptions, and many legislative changes would be required. Yet, a start has already been made in this direction. The Finance Bill 2020 recognises that the problem of fraudulent input tax credit claims using fake invoices has implications not only for evasion of GST but income tax as well. The new section 271AAD of the Income Tax Act, therefore, proposes to levy a penalty if such fake invoices are detected during income tax proceedings, creating a cross-linkage between GST and income tax. Legal protocols for data sharing between CBDT and CBIC are also in operation, which will help tackle misreporting by taxpayers.

Alongside legislative changes, there is also a strong need for training revenue officers in both the taxation systems since both taxes are an integral part of business taxation. National tax academies at Faridabad (NACIN) and Nagpur (NADT) are already doing this, but the scope can be further widened, especially since GST is a new law. Such measures will go a long way in creating an equitable, simple, and efficient tax administration, in line with the prime minister’s vision.

The ED claimed that the action under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) has led to detection of “huge evasion” of customs duty, GST as well as Income Tax.

“The ED received reliable input that Maharaja Jewellers (proprietor Tara Chand Soni), Bhagwati Jewellers (owner Ram Gopal Soni) and Ladiwala Associates (owner Honey Ladiwala) of Jaipur were purchasing smuggled gold bars from Harsh Bothra of Chennai and Banka Bullions Pvt. Ltd etc,” the agency said in a statement.

While acting on the information, it was found that various individuals were involved in smuggling of gold bars and subsequent dispatch of those to Jaipur. Gold bars were mainly arriving in Jaipur via Kolkata and had high purity level, it said.

The suspects used to remove the foreign mark of manufacturer or bank engraved or embossed on the gold bars and then smuggle those into the country, the ED said. These bars were then dispatched to various domestic markets by different modes of transportation to evade action from the law enforcement agencies.

The accused jewellers did not account for jewellery manufactured from smuggled gold and illegal funds generated were then transferred through hawala agents based in these cities, the agency said.

Hawala denotes the illegal manner of transferring funds by skirting banking channels and dealing in cash through agents.

“Searches at various premises in Jaipur, Kolkata and Chennai resulted in seizure of unaccounted Indian and foreign currency worth Rs 3.75 crore, gold bar and jewellery weighing 26.97 kg and silver weighing 12.22 kg along with incriminating documents.

307,"Centre must devise mechanism for GST compensation, says WB finance minister","Amit Mitra, West Bengal finance minister

West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra on Thursday said that it was for the Central government to devise a mechanism for payment of compensation to states under Goods and Services Tax (GST), if the fund set up for the purpose runs dry, as the relevant law is silent on an alternative mechanism.

Mitra said that five states (Delhi, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Kerala and Punjab) alone had dues worth nearly Rs 10,000 crore for the August-September period. “The compensation dues for all states together till October could well be around Rs 40,000 crore,” he added. On Wednesday, these states had claimed that the Centre had delayed compensation payment to them, which should have been paid by October-end.

According to government data, the amount collected under compensation cess fund for the April-October period is at Rs 56,000 crore. The government has so far disbursed about Rs 45,000 crore for the first four months (April-July) of the fiscal.

“If there is no money in the fund, call a GST Council meeting and tell the states the way forward,” Mitra said. Responding to a query on whether the payment deferment was restricted to non-BJP ruled states, Mitra said that he had spoken to finance minister of three BJP-ruled states and they confirmed that no payment had been made to them either.

Under the GST regime, the central government has provided states with a constitutional guarantee that their GST revenue growth of 14% year-on-year would be protected for a period of five year. This would be achieved by bridging the revenue shortfall from the fund which consists of collection from cess levied on luxury and sin items.

This guarantee ‘was a necessary enabler in states agreeing to subsume their fiscal sovereignty into GST,’ the state finance ministers had said.

Mitra also called demonetisation and an ill-timed GST implementation as structural hits to the economy, which could see a yearly GDP growth fall below 5% for the current fiscal.",info,"“The compensation dues for all states together till October could well be around Rs 40,000 crore,” he added.

The operation covered entities in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh.

In Maharashtra, the operation was conducted in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Solapur and Kolhapur.

The joint operation by the two premier intelligence agencies of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) was the first such action in its history of CBIC, which involved 1,200 officers from both agencies.

On the basis of data analytics, intelligence was gathered in coordination by both agencies. It was revealed that some exporters sent goods abroad on payment of tax (IGST), being done almost entirely out of the Input Tax Credit (ITC) availed on basis of ineligible or fake supplies.

Further, such IGST payment was claimed as refund on export. Based on the data provided by the Directorate General of Analytics and Risk Management (DGARM), the analysis was conducted, wherein certain red flag indicator filters were applied to customs export data, in conjunction with the corresponding GST data of the exporters. It was noticed that there was no or negligible payment of tax through cash by exporters and suppliers.

In a few cases, even tax paid through ITC was more than the ITC availed by these firms. On the basis of this intelligence, massive searches were conducted on the premises of these exporters and their suppliers. The day-long operation revealed that many of the entities spread across the length and breadth of the country were non-existent or had given fictitious addresses.

The preliminary examination of the documents along with statements recorded indicated that an Input Tax Credit of more than Rs 470 crore (Invoice value of approximately Rs 3,500 crore) was bogus, which has been utilised by exporters for effecting exports on payment of IGST through ITC and claiming consequential cash refund of the same.

Of this, tax sleuths have recovered an amount of Rs 25,000 crore during this period, as per the data available with the finance ministry. The revenue department of the ministry has registered around 37,000 cases in the last fiscal.

The cases registered by the tax authorities range from misuse of Input Tax Credit (ITC), mis-declaration to non-filing of GST returns. The most common modus operandi of evasion is the use of fake invoices. Close to 2,000 cases of fake invoices involving Rs 8,000 crore were registered during 2018-19. Tax sleuths recovered Rs 736 crore of the total tax evaded on account of fake invoices.

According to experts, this will be a small percentage of the tax leakage that takes place in the system. There are, however, no formal estimates to show the possible tax evasion that takes place in the country.

IN BROAD DAYLIGHT Of this, tax sleuths have recovered an amount of Rs 25,000 crore during this period, as per the data available with the finance ministry

The revenue department of the ministry has registered around 37,000 cases in the last fiscal.

“What one can say about gold smuggling is that 3-10% of the smuggled amount of gold gets detected. Similarly, only a small percentage of GST gets detected. But it is difficult to say the same for GST unless there is a proper study,” said Arun Kumar, former professor of Economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

It is difficult to detect tax evasion given the complexity of GST. “The complex system lends itself to tax evasion. Many items are exempt from taxes which breaks the chain. For example, wheat is exempt, atta (flour) is not. You can evade taxes on the amount of wheat you are buying and therefore not pay on the atta you sell by under-invoicing. There are many other items like these that are tax-exempt. This enables the generation of fake invoices. Tax leakage takes place further when people on the basis of fake bills claim fake credit through ITC,” he said.

""Earlier, the evasion of excise and sales tax was rampant through under-invoicing, over-invoicing and fake invoicing. The tax leakage continues to take place the same way even in the new tax regime,” said Shashi Bhushan Singh, former member, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs. The GST was implemented in July 2017 after the single tax subsumed various taxes, including excise and sales tax. All the goods and services were placed under 0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% tax slabs.

In the first year of implementation of the new regime, tax sleuths detected GST evasion of over Rs 4,400 crore.

""Fake companies are being set up to claim ITC. It is difficult to detect them where the entire chain of production of supply is outside the bill network. That's why a small percentage of the entire amount of GST gets collected,” said Kumar.

GST collections have been stagnating at around Rs 1 lakh for the last few months against the monthly target of Rs 1.14 lakh crore for the current financial year. Last year, the shortfall in GST was to the tune of Rs 80,000 crore with the monthly collections averaging around Rs 97,000 crore, whereas the target was Rs 1.1 lakh crore.

Professor Kumar suggests simplifying the destination tax by levying tax at the final stage. “The GST should be levied on the final consumption, leaving out the intermediate stages of production and distribution. Currently, a product is taxed at 100 places and scores of entries are required to be made. Since the complexities of GST arises due to the various intermediate stages of transactions, sales, production, transportation, accounting.. why not simplify the tax by eliminating the intermediate stages of tax. These stages are anyway passing on the tax to the final stage. At the earlier stages, one pays tax on inputs and claims the credit through ITC,” Kumar said.",info,"The government has detected Goods and Services Tax (GST) evasion of over Rs 45,000 crore during the financial year 2018-19.

316,Four booked for assaulting IRS officers probing GST fraud case in Gurugram,"gurugram

Updated: Aug 16, 2019 10:15 IST

A team of the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence, New Delhi, was allegedly assaulted by at least four persons when the officers were searching a house in Sushant Lok-1 in a GST-related case of fraud, the police said Thursday.

According to the complaint, this group had tried to hinder an IRS probe once earlier on April 12 in Paschim Vihar, Delhi.

On Thursday, an IRS team had come to Gurugram with a search warrant and were conducting a probe when a group of men started abusing the officers and tried to hamper the raid, the police said.

In the police complaint, the complainant, a senior intelligence officer, stated that during their investigation, several persons gathered outside the house’s main gate and started abusing the officers.

“We alerted the police officers following which two policemen came to the spot. To allow the police officers to enter, we opened the gate. This is when four men from the group that was outside forcibly barged into the house. We tried to reason with them that they are obstructing our probe, but one of them pushed a person who was being interrogated,” the IRS officer said.

The complainant added that on April 12, the same group of people had allegedly intervened and tried to obstruct a raid in Paschim Vihar, Delhi.

The police said that a special police officer immediately informed the Sector 29 police station and a team reached the spot.

A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said the accused managed to escape. “The complainant has shared some evidence, including video footage of the incident. We are investigating but no one has been arrested as yet,” said the official.

A case was registered against the accused persons under section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 353 (assault to deter public servant from discharge of duty) of Indian Penal Code at Sector 29 police station.",other,"gurugramUpdated: Aug 16, 2019 10:15 ISTA team of the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence, New Delhi, was allegedly assaulted by at least four persons when the officers were searching a house in Sushant Lok-1 in a GST-related case of fraud, the police said Thursday.

317,"Government blocks Rs 40,000 crore GST claims on returns mismatch","(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has frozen tax credits of around Rs 40,000 crore as the returns did not match, exposing alleged fraud by close to 2,000 entities, apart from cases where returns were not filed. Last week, the indirect tax wing of the revenue department blocked the credits within four hours, CBIC chairman John Joseph said at an event on Monday.Companies are entitled to credits on tax paid on inputs in the production chain so that there is no cascading effect of taxes. But major discrepancies in returns and instances of a large number of frauds prompted the government to crack the whip.There have been multiple ways in which frauds have been taken place. Sources said, the department had collected data on mismatch of over 20% in the initial GSTR-1 filing for the month and the final GSTR-3B returns. Subsequently, the bar was lowered to a difference of 10% and the government used various red flags to then identify companies, while completely relying on data instead of sending tax inspectors to premises to check for books.The standard operating procedure developed by the revenue department is to share the data with the state governments, which then move in, first asking them to make the corrections or pay up.But the scrutiny of the data has revealed that several flyby-night operators were misusing the benefit. There were entities which were set up just for the sake of showing bogus turnover and relied on a web of shell companies. These companies, many of which used forged documents, then vanished from the scene, prompting the government to tighten norms for GST registration.“In many cases it has been found that traders purchased iron and steel scrap but raised GST bills for garments to exporters, who in turn claimed refund of IGST (integrated GST) paid on export,” said a tax lawyer.",tax evasion,"(Representative image)NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has frozen tax credits of around Rs 40,000 crore as the returns did not match, exposing alleged fraud by close to 2,000 entities, apart from cases where returns were not filed.

The finance ministry on Monday said that the central GST authorities have detected evasion of Rs 70,206 crore between July 1, 2017 launch of GST and January, 2020. The tax department managed to recover nearly half of this amount (Rs 34,591 crore), minister of state for finance Anurag Singh Thakur said in Lok Sabha.
